# Content tree plugin

This plugin gets information from the `DocPage` and `ReadmePage` collections and creates a temporary [`pagesTrees.json`](../../../../../temp/pagesTrees.json) file which is used by [`ContentTree.vue`](../../../../components/layout/ContentTree.vue) to build the website's content tree.
