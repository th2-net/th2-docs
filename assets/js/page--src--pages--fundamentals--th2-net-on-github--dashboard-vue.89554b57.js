It means the users should update their code to work with the new DS lib.\\r\\n\\r\\nVersion 0.6.x won\'t have new features but will have bug fixes.\\r\\n\\r\\nVersion 1.x.y doesn\'t use any adapters by default, 0.6.x does. If you need the save behavior as previous,\\r\\nuse `CodecPipelinesAdapter` manually.\\r\\n\\r\\n## User impact and migration instructions\\r\\n\\r\\n1. [I] There is no more old-style DataSource class.  \\r\\n   [M] Use a specific class for your purposes (HTTPDataSource or GRPCDataSource).\\r\\n2. [I] There are no more `get_x` methods in the DataSource classes. Instead, it has the command method. This method\\r\\n   takes an object of the Command class.  \\r\\n   [M] So if you used `data_source.get_events_from_data_provider` use `data_source.command(GetEvents(ARGS))` instead.  \\r\\n   from `data_source.get_messages_from_data_provider` to `data_source.command(GetMessages(ARGS).apply_adapter(\\r\\n   codec_pipeline_adapter))`  \\r\\n   from `find_messages_by_id_from_data_provider` to `GetMessagesById` or `GetMessageById`  \\r\\n   from `find_events_by_id_from_data_provider` to `GetEventsById` or `GetEventById`  \\r\\n   if you used broken_events parameter initialize the command with use_stub=True parameter.\\r\\n3. [I] Modules structure was changed.  \\r\\n   [M] You need to change some import paths.\\r\\n4. [I] All class constructors/methods have got explicit arguments.  \\r\\n   [M] Change old args names to new if required.\\r\\n5. [I] Set of classes to create `EventsTree` representation was significantly changed.\\r\\n   [M] Use `EventsTreesCollection` instead of `EventsTree`. `EventsTree` is a real tree structure now. \\r\\n   Note, `EventsTreesCollection` has other methods, see the example to understand how to work with it.\\r\\n6. [I] `EventsTree2` was removed.  \\r\\n   [M] Use `EventsTreesCollection` instead.\\r\\n7. [I] Exceptions were updated.  \\r\\n   [M] Update your try-except statements\\r\\n\\r\\n## Improvements\\r\\n\\r\\n1. [TH2-3247] Move DS version 1.0.0 to python 3.7+\\r\\n2. [TH2-3404] Exceptions were updated. Implemented library-based exceptions.\\r\\n3. [TH2-3213] Old `data_source` module was removed.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Features\\r\\n\\r\\n1. [TH2-2465] Added the module `th2_gui_report` to create a link by event id or message id.\\r\\n2. [TH2-2274] rpt-data-provider GRPC interface was implemented.\\r\\n3. [TH2-3194] New `EventsTree` solution implemented. It includes the best parts from previous trees. \\r\\n   The tree also got a lot of useful methods to work with it ([see doc](documentation/api/events_tree.events_tree.md)). \\r\\n4. [TH2-2942] Pure Provider v5 APIs implemented: `GRPCProvider5API`, `HTTPProvider5API`.\\r\\n5. [TH2-2944] Developed commands for http and grpc instead of `data_source` get/find methods.\\r\\n6. [TH2-2994] Provider v5 data source classes implemented: `GRPCProvider5DataSource`, `HTTPProvider5DataSource`.\\r\\n7. [TH2-2941] Interface classes implemented:  `ISourceAPI`, `IDataSource`, `ICommand`, `IAdapter`.\\r\\n\\r\\n## BugFixes\\r\\n\\r\\n1. [TH2-3168] Fixed iterations in nested loops for Data object with limit.\\r\\n2. [TH2-3354] API Doc generator issue fixed.\\r\\n3.

[I] The last \\"messageIds\\" message in the messages stream will be ignored.  \\r\\n   [M] If you do checks for the last message, you can delete them.\\r\\n3. [I] _DataSource.write_to_txt_ was moved to Data. The name has been changed to _write_to_file_.  \\r\\n   [M] If you use _write_to_file_ function, change the corresponding class and method.\\r\\n4.

Drain interval - interval in milliseconds to drain all aggregated batches that are not stored yet, the default value is 1000. Termination timeout - timeout in milliseconds to wait for the inner drain scheduler to finish all the tasks, the default value is 5000.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Use timeout property from cradle_manager.json\\r\\n\\r\\nMstore uses some cradle settings during work. \\r\\nTimeout defines the maximum limit in milliseconds for inserting new data into the cradle. If set to 0 or omitted, the default value of 5000 is used.\\r\\nMax message batch size (`cradleMaxMessageBatchSize`) is used by mstore to implement rebatch feature.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Check message timestamp growing\\r\\n\\r\\nSequence and timestamp of incoming messages should always grow within the session alias and direction. Mstore already checks sequences growing, this version also checks timestamp growing. Mstore rejects the whole batch if the sequence number or timestamp of the first message is less or equal options than the last stored message.\\r\\n\\r\\n### [store-common](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-store-common) is not needed anymore\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were some common methods for converting and storing.

It is mean estore gets events and stores them in a separate thread pool without blocking MQ listening tread in most cases. MQ listening thread is blocked when the thread pool for asynchronously storing is over and can\'t begin storing a new event.\\r\\nThis approach increases the throughput of the store. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Use timeout property from cradle_manager.json\\r\\n\\r\\nEstore uses some cradle\'s settings during work. \\r\\nTimeout defines maximum time limit in milliseconds for inserting new data into cradle. If set to 0 or ommited, the default value of 5000 is used.\\r\\nMax event batch size (`cradleMaxEventBatchSize`) is used by estore to implement rebatch feature.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Compressed metadata for events\\r\\n\\r\\nImplemented compression of batch events metadata after serialization. Metadata is decompressed before deserialization. If decompression fails due to data format, deserialization is made on given bytes, meaning that metadata was written by an old version of Cradle API.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Disable waiting for connection recovery when closing the SubscribeMonitor\\r\\n\\r\\nDependency to common library has been updated from `3.13.4` to `3.35.0` and cradle from `2.9.1` to `2.21.0`.\\r\\n\\r\\n### [store-common](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-store-common) is not needed anymore\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were some common methods for convert and store.

What’s new in release 2.20.1\\r\\n\\r\\n## New features\\r\\n\\r\\n* ### Implemented a delay between retrying a request\\r\\n\\r\\n  When a Cassandra node is overloaded with requests, it can degrade performance and retry by timeout multiple requests at the same time. Which loads the node even more. To avoid this behavior, repeated attempts do not occur immediately, but after a certain time, which exponentially increases with the growth of the attempts counter.\\r\\n  \\r\\n* ### Implemented the `FixedNumberRetryPolicy` for queries that return a single row from storage\\r\\n  For queries that return a single row from storage, the concept of page size does not apply.  FixedNumberRetryPolicy is implemented for retry such queries.\\r\\n\\r\\n* ### Upgraded to Cassandra Java Driver 4.6.1, excluded unused dependencies.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Fixed bugs\\r\\n\\r\\n* ### Fixed bug with filtering message batches when left border of the filter falls into the middle of the batch","$loki":27},{"id":"54576635","$uid":"e5b1cd44e12c93bbff33492845aef668","internal":{"typeName":"Release","timestamp":1673641165749},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/th2-net/cradleapi/releases/54576635","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/th2-net/cradleapi/releases/54576635/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/th2-net/cradleapi/releases/54576635/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/th2-net/cradleapi/releases/tag/3.0","author":{"login":"MrJonniK","id":23455962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDU1OTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23455962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJonniK","html_url":"https://github.com/MrJonniK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJonniK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJonniK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJonniK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJonniK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJonniK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJonniK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJonniK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJonniK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJonniK/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOEpkAHs4DQMX7","tag_name":"3.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"Release 3.0.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2021-12-03T11:57:35Z","published_at":"2021-12-03T13:17:14Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/th2-net/cradleapi/tarball/3.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/th2-net/cradleapi/zipball/3.0","body":"# What’s new in release 3.0.0\\r\\n\\r\\n## New features\\r\\n\\r\\n* ### Event metadata, event body and collection of linked message ids are stored in the same table `time_test_events`\\r\\n\\r\\n  Earlier, the events body was stored in table test_events.

You can find changes [here](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-common-j/blob/6f8699bdc2d194d4f12aeb964d5d562d2fdcdf76/README.md#3330)\\r\\n\\r\\n+ kotlin version is updated to 1.5.30\\r\\n\\r\\n+ sailfish-core version is updated to 3.2.1741\\r\\n  + Sailfish service based on MINA decodes the message as sender during sending.\\r\\n    This approach is important for protocols in which a pair of messages have the same protocol message type and different structures depending on the direction \\r\\n\\r\\n# Added:\\r\\n\\r\\n+ Message sending failure reporting (creates events when an exception was thrown during sending message) \\r\\n\\r\\n+ th2_conn_incoming_msg_quantity and th2_conn_outgoing_msg_quantity metrics are produced by conn \\r\\n\\r\\n+ Option for disabling generation of an event for sent message if it has parent_event_id \\r\\n\\r\\n+ Option for configuring maxMessageBatchSize for th2 message sending to mstore (other components) \\r\\n\\r\\n+ Check for missing sequences in a batch (the error will be written in the log) \\r\\n\\r\\n# Fixed:\\r\\n\\r\\n+ Fix problem with trying to send EvolutionBatch message. Unwraps the EvolutionBatch when sending raw message \\r\\n\\r\\n+ Problem with dropped messages when the significant load was directed to conn box.

What\'s new in codec 3.12.3\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new codec release contains important features and bug fixes.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Features\\r\\n\\r\\n### Error reporting\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new version of the codec reports errors that happened during encoding or decoding as events.\\r\\nThe error event will be attached either to the codec\'s events (`DecodeError` or `EncodeError`) or to the event\\r\\nwhich ID is specified in `parent_event_id` parameter in the message.\\r\\nThis event will have information about the cause of the error and the link to the actual message that caused the error.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe codec groups events into batches and sends them when the timeout is exceeded or batch size has reached the limit.\\r\\nYou can correct the timeout and batch size by those parameters:\\r\\n+ **outgoingEventBatchBuildTime** - the timeout in seconds during which the codec will hold events and try to group them into a batch;\\r\\n+ **maxOutgoingEventBatchSize** - the max batch size to accumulate events before sending to the estore\\r\\n\\r\\n### Producing an error message placeholder during decoding\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case any error has occurred during message decoding no decoded result is produced in the previous codec version.\\r\\nBecause of that, components (such as rpt-data-provider) that expect to get an answer for each message they sent to the codec\\r\\nhave to wait for the response timeout to be exceeded. It delays the time when the user sees the decoding results.\\r\\nThe new version of the codec produces an error message placeholder with information about the reason why the message was not decoded.\\r\\nAs a result, the end-user will see the normally decoded message in the UI.\\r\\nAlso, the user will see messages that were not decoded correctly and the reason why it has happened. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Removing trailing zeros\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the field in the dictionary has the type `java.math.BigDecimal` the decoded value might have insignificant zeroes at the end.\\r\\nFor example, 1.000. If you don\'t want to have trailing zeroes in the decoded message you can use `stripTrailingZeros` parameter.\\r\\n\\r\\n```yaml\\r\\nspec:\\r\\n  custom-config:\\r\\n    converterParameters:\\r\\n      stripTrailingZeros: true\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Ignoring enum values during encoding\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes you need to send a field that has a limited number of possible values with the value that is not in that list.\\r\\nIn the previous codec, you will have to update the dictionary to do that. The new version has a parameter that allows you to enable such functionality.\\r\\nBy default, it does not allow unknown values for those fields.\\r\\n\\r\\n```yaml\\r\\nspec:\\r\\n  custom-config:\\r\\n    converterParameters:\\r\\n      allowUnknownEnumValues: true\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Fixes\\r\\n\\r\\n### The filtering by message type\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the previous version, the filtering by message type on pins did not work. The new version contains fixes for that.\\r\\nNow filters like this works without any changes in the pin definition.\\r\\n```yaml\\r\\nspec:\\r\\n  pins:\\r\\n    # decoder\\r\\n    - name: out_codec_decode_first_session_alias\\r\\n      connection-type: mq\\r\\n      attributes: [\'decoder_out\', \'parsed\', \'publish\', \'first_session_alias\']\\r\\n      filters:\\r\\n        - metadata:\\r\\n            - field-name: message_type\\r\\n              expected-value: MessageA\\r\\n              operation:

What\'s new in release 3.9.0\\r\\n\\r\\nTo work with check1 3.9.0 you need to install the grpc-check1 library with version [3.5.1](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-grpc-check1/releases/tag/v3.5.1) or higher.\\r\\n\\r\\n## New features\\r\\n\\r\\n### Silence check after CheckSequence rule and NoMessageCheck rule\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some cases when you expect some messages sequence to be received and nothing more matches key fields in that sequence is received after that.\\r\\nIn the previous check1 version, there was no such functionality.\\r\\nThe release 3.9.0 introduces two ways of doing that:\\r\\n+ Automated silence check after CheckSequence rule;\\r\\n+ NoMessageCheck rule for manual verification.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Silence check\\r\\n\\r\\nThis functionality adds verification that no more messages that match the `pre-filter` in the CheckSequence rule\\r\\nwas received after the rule main CheckSequence rule is completed.\\r\\nThe timeout for which the silence check awaits the messages is either the `cleanup timeout` (`cleanup-older-than` + `cleanup-time-unit`) is exceeded\\r\\nor the next rule has been submitted to the chain.\\r\\nYou can enable it per request by `silence_check` parameter.\\r\\n```python\\r\\nfrom google.protobuf import wrappers_pb2 as wrappers\\r\\n\\r\\nCheckSequenceRuleRequest(\\r\\n  # ...\\r\\n  silence_check=wrappers.BoolValue(value=True) # or False, or you might not set silence_check at all\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n```java\\r\\nimport com.exactpro.th2.check1.grpc.CheckSequenceRuleRequest;\\r\\n\\r\\nCheckSequenceRuleRequest.newBuilder()\\r\\n    .setSilenceCheck(BoolValue.of(true)) // or false, or you might not set silenceCheck at all\\r\\n```\\r\\nIf it is not set the silence check will be added automatically if the `auto-silence-check-after-sequence-rule` in check1 configuration is enabled.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### NoMessagesCheck rule\\r\\n\\r\\nThis rule allows you to check that no messages that match the specified filter were received during a certain time period.\\r\\nIt is very similar to the silence check but can be used independently.\\r\\nThe timeout for the rule might be specified based on real-time or messages time.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Timeout for rules based on the message\'s time\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current version of check1 allows you to specify the timeout that is based on real-time.\\r\\nWhen a user specifies the small timeout to make sure that messages were received quickly enough it might cause unexpected rule failure.\\r\\nIt happens because check1 processes messages with a different speed depending on the load and resources.\\r\\nAnd in some cases, the message you need to verify might be received by check1 but not yet processed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere comes the `message_timeout` parameter. It allows you to specify the timeout based on the messages\' timestamps.\\r\\n**Please note, that using `message_timeout` requires either a `checkpoint` or an existing `chain_id`.**\\r\\nThey are required to compute borders for message timestamp. \\r\\nYou can specify a small `message_timeout` and a bigger `timeout` to allow check1 process messages.\\r\\nWhen it sees the message with a timestamp that exceeds the computed borders it completes the rule. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Default `timeout`\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a new `rule-execution-timeout` parameter that allows you to specify the default `timeout`\\r\\nfor rule execution if the request does not contain one.\\r\\nIt allows you to specify only the `message_timeout` in the request.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Precision for comparing numbers and date-time values\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new version of check1 allows you to use precision for comparing numbers and date-time values.\\r\\nTo get the advantage of comparison with the precision you should use `EQ_TIME_PRECISION` or `EQ_DECIMAL_PRECISION` operation\\r\\ndepending on the value type you try to compare.\\r\\nThere are default precisions for those operations. They can be specified using `time-precision` and `decimal-precision` parameters in check1 configuration.\\r\\nAlso, you can specify the precision per filter. The `RootComparisonSettings` now has two parameters:\\r\\n* **time_precision** - is used to specify the precision for comparing date-time values (please note, that they should be represented in ISO format)\\r\\n  Examples:\\r\\n  ```python\\r\\n  import datetime\\r\\n  \\r\\n  td = datetime.timedelta(days=3, minutes=10)\\r\\n  duration = Duration()\\r\\n  duration.FromTimedelta(td)\\r\\n  RootComparisonSettings(\\r\\n    # other parameters\\r\\n    time_precision=duration\\r\\n  )\\r\\n  ```\\r\\n  ```java\\r\\n  import com.exactpro.th2.common.grpc.RootComparisonSettings;\\r\\n  import com.google.protobuf.util.Durations;\\r\\n  \\r\\n  RootComparisonSettings.newBuilder()\\r\\n    .setTimePrecision(Durations.fromMillis(100))\\r\\n    .build();\\r\\n  ```\\r\\n* **decimal_precision** - is used to specify the precision for comparing numbers. Can be in engineering format and the regular one (e.g. 125E-3 or 0.125)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Null value filter\\r\\n\\r\\nNow you can assert that the message contains some field with `null` value (the field presents in the message but it has a value of `null`).\\r\\nNOTE: only EQUAL and NOT_EQUAL operations are supported.\\r\\n\\r\\nExample:\\r\\n```python\\r\\nValueFilter(\\r\\n  operation=FilterOperation.EQUAL,\\r\\n  null_value=NullValue\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n```java\\r\\nimport com.exactpro.th2.common.grpc.ValueFilter;\\r\\nimport com.exactpro.th2.common.grpc.NullValue;\\r\\n\\r\\nValueFilter.newBuilder()\\r\\n    .setOperation(FilterOperation.EQUAL)\\r\\n    .setNullValue(NullValue.NULL_VALUE)\\r\\n    .build();\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n### Consider null value in a message as empty\\r\\n\\r\\nThe default behavior regarding `null` values in a message has been changed in check1.\\r\\nIf the field presents in the message and has the value `null` the EMPTY filter won\'t pass anymore.\\r\\nThe opposite for NOT_EMPTY. It will pass in case the field exists but has a `null` value.\\r\\nIf you want to enable the old behavior you can switch it using `check-null-value-as-empty` parameter in the check1 configuration.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Failure reason improvements\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you specify the filter and the actual message has that field but the content type is different (you expected the simple value but a sub-message was received in the message)\\r\\nthe old version of check1 did not say anything useful and just marked the field as failed.\\r\\nAlso, when something happened during field comparison there was no information about what has happened. \\r\\nStarting with version 3.9.0 the `hint` is added in these cases. You will see in the UI a message that explains what has happened.\\r\\nNOTE: this improvement will work only with a report-viewer version 3.1.95 or higher.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Displaying `null` and string values in verification\\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous version of check1 did not separate the `null` value and the string `\\"null\\"`.\\r\\nIt might cause a misunderstanding of the verification result. Version 3.9.0 reports the values regarding the actual value.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE: this improvement will work only with a report-viewer version 3.1.102 or higher.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Fixes\\r\\n\\r\\n### failUnexpected parameter was not propagated to sub-messages\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a problem when you specify the `failUnxpected` parameter but fields in sub-messages (or collections of messages)\\r\\ndoes not cause a failure. That was happening because the parameter\'s value was not propagated to the sub-messages.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Incorrect matching of repeating groups\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a problem with matching repeating groups when the filter contains fewer elements than the actual message\\r\\nand they are received in a different order. In this case, check1 might match the incorrect elements and the verification result might confuse users.","$loki":13},{"id":"51444929","$uid":"a5ff7029f600a0104fbccbf8099ffb68","internal":{"typeName":"Release","timestamp":1673641159363},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/th2-net/th2-check1/releases/51444929","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/th2-net/th2-check1/releases/51444929/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/th2-net/th2-check1/releases/51444929/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/th2-net/th2-check1/releases/tag/v3.8.0","author":{"login":"OptimumOpium","id":23560203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTYwMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23560203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptimumOpium","html_url":"https://github.com/OptimumOpium","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptimumOpium/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptimumOpium/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptimumOpium/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptimumOpium/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptimumOpium/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptimumOpium/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptimumOpium/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptimumOpium/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptimumOpium/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOEsMYBM4DEPzB","tag_name":"v3.8.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"Release 3.8.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2021-10-13T10:02:23Z","published_at":"2021-10-15T16:38:43Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/th2-net/th2-check1/tarball/v3.8.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/th2-net/th2-check1/zipball/v3.8.0","body":"# What’s new in release 3.8.0\\r\\n\\r\\n**To work with check1 3.8.0 you need to install the grpc-check1 library with version [3.4.2](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-grpc-check1/releases/tag/v3.4.2) or higher.**\\r\\n\\r\\n## New features\\r\\n\\r\\n### Description for each verification in CheckSequenceRule\\r\\n\\r\\nNow `RootMessageFilter` has an optional field `description` that can be used to add custom information to a verification event in check1.\\r\\n```python\\r\\nfrom google.protobuf import wrappers_pb2 as wrappers\\r\\n\\r\\n# ...\\r\\n\\r\\nRootMessageFilter(\\r\\n  messageType=\\"YourMessage\\",\\r\\n  message_filter=MessageFilter(...),\\r\\n  description=wrappers.StringValue(\\"You description\\")\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### New filter operations are added to ValueFilter\\r\\n\\r\\nCheck1 now has support for new operation for checking field\'s value:\\r\\n\\r\\n**IN/NOT_IN** - check if the value of the field presents/does not present in the specified list\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nValueFilter(\\r\\n    simple_list=SimpleList(simple_values=[\\"A\\", \\"B\\"]),\\r\\n    operation=FilterOperation.IN # or FilterOperation.NOT_IN\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**LIKE/NOT_LIKE** - check if the value of the field matches or not the specified regexp\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nValueFilter(\\r\\n    simple_filter=\\"your[Rr]egexp.*\\",\\r\\n    operation=FilterOperation.LIKE # or FilterOperation.NOT_LIKE\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**LESS/MORE/NOT_LESS/NOT_MORE** - compares the value of the field with the specified value.

Supports all new operations.\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nfrom th2_grpc_check1.check1_pb2 import PreFilter\\r\\nfrom th2_grpc_common.common_pb2 import RootMessageFilter, MetadataFilter, FilterOperation\\r\\n\\r\\n# ...\\r\\n\\r\\n# message filter\\r\\nRootMessageFilter(\\r\\n    metadata_filter=MetadataFilter(\\r\\n        property_filters={\\r\\n            \'test.prop\': MetadataFilter.SimpleFilter(\\r\\n                operation=FilterOperation.EQUAL,\\r\\n                value=\\"test\\"\\r\\n            ),\\r\\n            \'another.prop\': MetadataFilter.SimpleFilter(\\r\\n                operation=FilterOperation.IN,\\r\\n                simple_list=SimpleList(simple_values=[\\"A\\", \\"B\\"])\\r\\n            )\\r\\n        }\\r\\n    )\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n# pre-filter\\r\\nPreFilter(\\r\\n    metadata_filter=MetadataFilter(\\r\\n        property_filters={\\r\\n            \'test.prop\': MetadataFilter.SimpleFilter(\\r\\n                operation=FilterOperation.EQUAL,\\r\\n                value=\\"test\\"\\r\\n            ),\\r\\n            \'another.prop\': MetadataFilter.SimpleFilter(\\r\\n                operation=FilterOperation.IN,\\r\\n                simple_list=SimpleList(simple_values=[\\"A\\", \\"B\\"])\\r\\n            )\\r\\n        }\\r\\n    )\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Verify repeating groups order in the message.\\r\\n\\r\\nAllows check1 to verify the order of the elements in the collection fields.\\r\\nIf the flag is set the check1 one will pass the comparison only if the actual order of elements in the collection matches the filter.\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nfrom th2_grpc_common.common_pb2 import RootMessageFilter, RootComparisonSettings, MessageFilter, ValueFilter, ListValue\\r\\n\\r\\n# ...\\r\\n\\r\\nRootMessageFilter(\\r\\n    metadata_filter=MessageFilter(\\r\\n        fields={\\r\\n            \'collection\': ValueFilter(\\r\\n                list_filter=ListValue(\\r\\n                    values=[\\r\\n                        ValueFilter(simple_filter=\\"1\\"),\\r\\n                        ValueFilter(simple_filter=\\"2\\")\\r\\n                    ]\\r\\n                )\\r\\n            )\\r\\n        }\\r\\n    ),\\r\\n    comparison_settings=RootComparisonSettings(\\r\\n        check_repeating_group_order=True\\r\\n    )\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Deprecations:\\r\\n\\r\\nSome existing properties in message filters and rule requests were deprecated and will be removed in a future major release.\\r\\nPlease, check the list below and migrate from the deprecated properties to new ones.\\r\\n\\r\\n### RootMessageFilter instead of MessageFilter\\r\\n\\r\\n`CheckRuleRequest` and `CheckSequenceRuleRequest` now uses `RootMessageFilter` for declaring the message\'s filter.\\r\\nIt contains the information about message type and filters for the message\'s body (`message_filter` field) and metadata (`metadata_filter` field).\\r\\nThe general settings for comparison were moved to the `RootMessageFilter` as well (`RootComparisonSettings` in `comparison_settings` field).\\r\\n\\r\\nOld check rule request example:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nCheckRuleRequest(\\r\\n  connectivity_id=ConnectionID(session_alias=\'test\'),\\r\\n  filter=MessageFilter(\\r\\n    messageType=\\"A\\",\\r\\n    comparison_settings=ComparisonSettings(\\r\\n      ignore_fields=[\'a\',\'b\'],\\r\\n      fail_unexpected=FailUnexpected.FIELDS\\r\\n    ),\\r\\n    fields={...}\\r\\n  ),\\r\\n  ...\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNew request:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nCheckRuleRequest(\\r\\n  connectivity_id=ConnectionID(session_alias=\'test\'),\\r\\n  root_filter=RootMessageFilter(\\r\\n    messageType=\\"A\\",\\r\\n    message_filter=MessageFilter(\\r\\n      fields={...},\\r\\n      comparison_settings=ComparisonSettings(fail_unexpected=FailUnexpected.FIELDS)\\r\\n    ),\\r\\n    comparison_settings=RootComparisonSettings(\\r\\n      ignore_fields=[\'a\',\'b\'],\\r\\n      check_repeating_group_order=true\\r\\n    )\\r\\n  ),\\r\\n  ...\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Reporting improvements:\\r\\n\\r\\n### Add metrics for view number of active caches and actual cache size into check1\\r\\n\\r\\nCheck1 now exports a number of metrics that will help to get information about current check1\'s state.\\r\\n\\r\\n* `th2_check1_actual_cache_number` - actual number of messages in caches\\r\\n* `th2_check1_active_tasks_number` - actual number of currently working rules\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `th2_check1_actual_cache_number` metric uses two labels:\\r\\n* `session_alias` - session alias of received message\\r\\n* `direction` - direction of received message\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `th2_check1_active_tasks_number` metric use `rule_type` label\\r\\n\\r\\n### \\"No message found\\" table improvements\\r\\n\\r\\nThe event with submitted filters when no messages were found became more informative:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Information about expected message\'s type and message\'s metadata extracted into a separate table;\\r\\n* The expected values in the submitted filter are displayed in a more convenient way (the operation and values are joined together);\\r\\n* Comparison settings extracted into a separate table.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Keep verification order for repeating groups matches the original order\\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous version of check1 displayed the elements of collections in verification from the best match to the worst match.\\r\\nIt could confuse users. They might start to think that the actual message has incorrect order of elements in the collection.\\r\\nThe new version respects the actual order and displays elements in the verification respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Correct reporting about incorrect parameters and internal errors\\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous version of check1 did not notify a user about incorrect parameters or internal errors during the message processing.\\r\\nNot check1 will verify request parameters and report an error if some parameters are not set or have incorrect values.\\r\\nWhen an internal error has occurred the event with its description will be created and added to the report.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Correct root event name for rules\\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous version of check1 created root events with rule type prefix and session alias and direction pair before the description set by the user. The new version changes that. The root event name now consists of the rule type prefix and the user\'s description. The information about the session alias and direction was moved to the event body.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Fixes:\\r\\n\\r\\n### Submitted rule begins executing before it has been configured fully\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an issue when the rule finds all it needs before it was fully initialized.\\r\\nThe new version fixes that issue and initializes the rule before it starts processing messages.","$loki":14},{"id":"34533779","$uid":"c0af3318f6a4de64bd65062cbd70dd89","internal":{"typeName":"Release","timestamp":1673641159363},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/th2-net/th2-check1/releases/34533779","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/th2-net/th2-check1/releases/34533779/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/th2-net/th2-check1/releases/34533779/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/th2-net/th2-check1/releases/tag/v2.4.0-beta","author":{"login":"alexander-zhilov","id":74956324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0OTU2MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74956324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov","html_url":"https://github.com/alexander-zhilov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM0NTMzNzc5","tag_name":"v2.4.0-beta","target_commitish":"master","name":"v2.4.0-beta","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2020-11-21T11:02:52Z","published_at":"2020-11-28T16:21:16Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/th2-net/th2-check1/tarball/v2.4.0-beta","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/th2-net/th2-check1/zipball/v2.4.0-beta","body":"Version

It is mean estore gets events and stores them in a separate thread pool without blocking MQ listening tread in most cases. MQ listening thread is blocked when the thread pool for asynchronously storing is over and can\'t begin storing a new event.\\r\\nThis approach increases the throughput of the store. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Use timeout property from cradle_manager.json\\r\\n\\r\\nEstore uses some cradle\'s settings during work. \\r\\nTimeout defines maximum time limit in milliseconds for inserting new data into cradle. If set to 0 or ommited, the default value of 5000 is used.\\r\\nMax event batch size (`cradleMaxEventBatchSize`) is used by estore to implement rebatch feature.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Compressed metadata for events\\r\\n\\r\\nImplemented compression of batch events metadata after serialization. Metadata is decompressed before deserialization. If decompression fails due to data format, deserialization is made on given bytes, meaning that metadata was written by an old version of Cradle API.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Disable waiting for connection recovery when closing the SubscribeMonitor\\r\\n\\r\\nDependency to common library has been updated from `3.13.4` to `3.35.0` and cradle from `2.9.1` to `2.21.0`.\\r\\n\\r\\n### [store-common](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-store-common) is not needed anymore\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were some common methods for convert and store.

Drain interval - interval in milliseconds to drain all aggregated batches that are not stored yet, the default value is 1000. Termination timeout - timeout in milliseconds to wait for the inner drain scheduler to finish all the tasks, the default value is 5000.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Use timeout property from cradle_manager.json\\r\\n\\r\\nMstore uses some cradle settings during work. \\r\\nTimeout defines the maximum limit in milliseconds for inserting new data into the cradle. If set to 0 or omitted, the default value of 5000 is used.\\r\\nMax message batch size (`cradleMaxMessageBatchSize`) is used by mstore to implement rebatch feature.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Check message timestamp growing\\r\\n\\r\\nSequence and timestamp of incoming messages should always grow within the session alias and direction. Mstore already checks sequences growing, this version also checks timestamp growing. Mstore rejects the whole batch if the sequence number or timestamp of the first message is less or equal options than the last stored message.\\r\\n\\r\\n### [store-common](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-store-common) is not needed anymore\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were some common methods for converting and storing.

What\'s new in release 3.9.0\\r\\n\\r\\nTo work with check1 3.9.0 you need to install the grpc-check1 library with version [3.5.1](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-grpc-check1/releases/tag/v3.5.1) or higher.\\r\\n\\r\\n## New features\\r\\n\\r\\n### Silence check after CheckSequence rule and NoMessageCheck rule\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some cases when you expect some messages sequence to be received and nothing more matches key fields in that sequence is received after that.\\r\\nIn the previous check1 version, there was no such functionality.\\r\\nThe release 3.9.0 introduces two ways of doing that:\\r\\n+ Automated silence check after CheckSequence rule;\\r\\n+ NoMessageCheck rule for manual verification.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Silence check\\r\\n\\r\\nThis functionality adds verification that no more messages that match the `pre-filter` in the CheckSequence rule\\r\\nwas received after the rule main CheckSequence rule is completed.\\r\\nThe timeout for which the silence check awaits the messages is either the `cleanup timeout` (`cleanup-older-than` + `cleanup-time-unit`) is exceeded\\r\\nor the next rule has been submitted to the chain.\\r\\nYou can enable it per request by `silence_check` parameter.\\r\\n```python\\r\\nfrom google.protobuf import wrappers_pb2 as wrappers\\r\\n\\r\\nCheckSequenceRuleRequest(\\r\\n  # ...\\r\\n  silence_check=wrappers.BoolValue(value=True) # or False, or you might not set silence_check at all\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n```java\\r\\nimport com.exactpro.th2.check1.grpc.CheckSequenceRuleRequest;\\r\\n\\r\\nCheckSequenceRuleRequest.newBuilder()\\r\\n    .setSilenceCheck(BoolValue.of(true)) // or false, or you might not set silenceCheck at all\\r\\n```\\r\\nIf it is not set the silence check will be added automatically if the `auto-silence-check-after-sequence-rule` in check1 configuration is enabled.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### NoMessagesCheck rule\\r\\n\\r\\nThis rule allows you to check that no messages that match the specified filter were received during a certain time period.\\r\\nIt is very similar to the silence check but can be used independently.\\r\\nThe timeout for the rule might be specified based on real-time or messages time.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Timeout for rules based on the message\'s time\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current version of check1 allows you to specify the timeout that is based on real-time.\\r\\nWhen a user specifies the small timeout to make sure that messages were received quickly enough it might cause unexpected rule failure.\\r\\nIt happens because check1 processes messages with a different speed depending on the load and resources.\\r\\nAnd in some cases, the message you need to verify might be received by check1 but not yet processed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere comes the `message_timeout` parameter. It allows you to specify the timeout based on the messages\' timestamps.\\r\\n**Please note, that using `message_timeout` requires either a `checkpoint` or an existing `chain_id`.**\\r\\nThey are required to compute borders for message timestamp. \\r\\nYou can specify a small `message_timeout` and a bigger `timeout` to allow check1 process messages.\\r\\nWhen it sees the message with a timestamp that exceeds the computed borders it completes the rule. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Default `timeout`\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a new `rule-execution-timeout` parameter that allows you to specify the default `timeout`\\r\\nfor rule execution if the request does not contain one.\\r\\nIt allows you to specify only the `message_timeout` in the request.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Precision for comparing numbers and date-time values\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new version of check1 allows you to use precision for comparing numbers and date-time values.\\r\\nTo get the advantage of comparison with the precision you should use `EQ_TIME_PRECISION` or `EQ_DECIMAL_PRECISION` operation\\r\\ndepending on the value type you try to compare.\\r\\nThere are default precisions for those operations. They can be specified using `time-precision` and `decimal-precision` parameters in check1 configuration.\\r\\nAlso, you can specify the precision per filter. The `RootComparisonSettings` now has two parameters:\\r\\n* **time_precision** - is used to specify the precision for comparing date-time values (please note, that they should be represented in ISO format)\\r\\n  Examples:\\r\\n  ```python\\r\\n  import datetime\\r\\n  \\r\\n  td = datetime.timedelta(days=3, minutes=10)\\r\\n  duration = Duration()\\r\\n  duration.FromTimedelta(td)\\r\\n  RootComparisonSettings(\\r\\n    # other parameters\\r\\n    time_precision=duration\\r\\n  )\\r\\n  ```\\r\\n  ```java\\r\\n  import com.exactpro.th2.common.grpc.RootComparisonSettings;\\r\\n  import com.google.protobuf.util.Durations;\\r\\n  \\r\\n  RootComparisonSettings.newBuilder()\\r\\n    .setTimePrecision(Durations.fromMillis(100))\\r\\n    .build();\\r\\n  ```\\r\\n* **decimal_precision** - is used to specify the precision for comparing numbers. Can be in engineering format and the regular one (e.g. 125E-3 or 0.125)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Null value filter\\r\\n\\r\\nNow you can assert that the message contains some field with `null` value (the field presents in the message but it has a value of `null`).\\r\\nNOTE: only EQUAL and NOT_EQUAL operations are supported.\\r\\n\\r\\nExample:\\r\\n```python\\r\\nValueFilter(\\r\\n  operation=FilterOperation.EQUAL,\\r\\n  null_value=NullValue\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n```java\\r\\nimport com.exactpro.th2.common.grpc.ValueFilter;\\r\\nimport com.exactpro.th2.common.grpc.NullValue;\\r\\n\\r\\nValueFilter.newBuilder()\\r\\n    .setOperation(FilterOperation.EQUAL)\\r\\n    .setNullValue(NullValue.NULL_VALUE)\\r\\n    .build();\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n### Consider null value in a message as empty\\r\\n\\r\\nThe default behavior regarding `null` values in a message has been changed in check1.\\r\\nIf the field presents in the message and has the value `null` the EMPTY filter won\'t pass anymore.\\r\\nThe opposite for NOT_EMPTY. It will pass in case the field exists but has a `null` value.\\r\\nIf you want to enable the old behavior you can switch it using `check-null-value-as-empty` parameter in the check1 configuration.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Failure reason improvements\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you specify the filter and the actual message has that field but the content type is different (you expected the simple value but a sub-message was received in the message)\\r\\nthe old version of check1 did not say anything useful and just marked the field as failed.\\r\\nAlso, when something happened during field comparison there was no information about what has happened. \\r\\nStarting with version 3.9.0 the `hint` is added in these cases. You will see in the UI a message that explains what has happened.\\r\\nNOTE: this improvement will work only with a report-viewer version 3.1.95 or higher.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Displaying `null` and string values in verification\\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous version of check1 did not separate the `null` value and the string `\\"null\\"`.\\r\\nIt might cause a misunderstanding of the verification result.

actual number of messages in caches\\r\\n* `th2_check1_active_tasks_number` - actual number of currently working rules\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `th2_check1_actual_cache_number` metric uses two labels:\\r\\n* `session_alias` - session alias of received message\\r\\n* `direction` - direction of received message\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `th2_check1_active_tasks_number` metric use `rule_type` label\\r\\n\\r\\n### \\"No message found\\" table improvements\\r\\n\\r\\nThe event with submitted filters when no messages were found became more informative:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Information about expected message\'s type and message\'s metadata extracted into a separate table;\\r\\n* The expected values in the submitted filter are displayed in a more convenient way (the operation and values are joined together);\\r\\n* Comparison settings extracted into a separate table.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Keep verification order for repeating groups matches the original order\\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous version of check1 displayed the elements of collections in verification from the best match to the worst match.\\r\\nIt could confuse users. They might start to think that the actual message has incorrect order of elements in the collection.\\r\\nThe new version respects the actual order and displays elements in the verification respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Correct reporting about incorrect parameters and internal errors\\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous version of check1 did not notify a user about incorrect parameters or internal errors during the message processing.\\r\\nNot check1 will verify request parameters and report an error if some parameters are not set or have incorrect values.\\r\\nWhen an internal error has occurred the event with its description will be created and added to the report.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Correct root event name for rules\\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous version of check1 created root events with rule type prefix and session alias and direction pair before the description set by the user. The new version changes that. The root event name now consists of the rule type prefix and the user\'s description. The information about the session alias and direction was moved to the event body.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Fixes:\\r\\n\\r\\n### Submitted rule begins executing before it has been configured fully\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an issue when the rule finds all it needs before it was fully initialized.\\r\\nThe new version fixes that issue and initializes the rule before it starts processing messages.","$loki":14},{"id":"34533779","$uid":"c0af3318f6a4de64bd65062cbd70dd89","internal":{"typeName":"Release","timestamp":1673641159363},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/th2-net/th2-check1/releases/34533779","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/th2-net/th2-check1/releases/34533779/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/th2-net/th2-check1/releases/34533779/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/th2-net/th2-check1/releases/tag/v2.4.0-beta","author":{"login":"alexander-zhilov","id":74956324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0OTU2MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74956324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov","html_url":"https://github.com/alexander-zhilov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-zhilov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM0NTMzNzc5","tag_name":"v2.4.0-beta","target_commitish":"master","name":"v2.4.0-beta","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2020-11-21T11:02:52Z","published_at":"2020-11-28T16:21:16Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/th2-net/th2-check1/tarball/v2.4.0-beta","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/th2-net/th2-check1/zipball/v2.4.0-beta","body":"Version

What\'s New\\r\\n\\r\\n+ The `submitNoMessageCheck` method added for submitting NoMessageCheck rule. It allows you to verify that there were no messages that match the certain filter;\\r\\n+ The `silence_check` parameter was added to the `CheckSequenceRuleRequest`. If it is set to `true` the check1 will also verify that there are no messages received that match the pre-filter after the main rule had finished. See details in check1 3.9.0 release notes.\\r\\n+ The `message_timeout` parameter was added to all rule requests. It allows you to specify a time for rule execution based on messages\' timestamp;\\r\\n+ The `time_precision` and `decimal_precision` parameters were added to `RootComparisonSettings`.
