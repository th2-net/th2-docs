component repository.\n\n## Functionality\n\n- The **mstore** automatically receives raw messages, parsed messages are not accepted. \n- The **mstore** saves these raw messages to th2's data lake.\n- The **mstore** uses the Cradle Api Library to write data into the data lake.\n- The **mstore** tracks all saved messages and ensures that messages are saved to the database in the correct order.\n\n## Configuration:\n\n**infra-schema** requires one **mstore** box description (custom resource).\n\n### Configuration parameters\n\n- `drain-interval` - interval in milliseconds to drain all aggregated batches that are not stored yet. \n- The default value is `1000`.\n\n- `termination-timeout` - the timeout in milliseconds to await for the inner drain scheduler to finish all the tasks. \n- The default value is `5000`.\n\n```yaml\n{\n  \"drain-interval\": 1000,\n  \"termination-timeout\": 5000\n}\n```\n\n### Required pins and links\nPin configuration is generated and managed by the **infra-operator**.\n\n\n### Configuration example\nGeneral view of the component looks like this:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: th2.exactpro.com/v1\nkind: Th2Mstore\nmetadata:\n  name: mstore\nspec:\n  image-name: ghcr.io/th2-net/th2-mstore\n  image-version: <image version>\n  custom-settings:\n    drain-interval: 1000\n    termination-timeout: 5000\n  extended-settings:\n    service:\n      enabled: false\n    envVariables:\n      JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: \"-XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError -Ddatastax-java-driver.advanced.connection.init-query-timeout=\\\"5000 milliseconds\\\"\"\n    resources:\n      limits:\n        memory: 500Mi\n        cpu: 200m\n      requests:\n        memory: 100Mi\n        cpu: 20m\n```\n\n## Useful hints\n\n### Raw Messages\n\nThe raw message is a base entity of th2.\nAll incoming / outgoing data is stored in this format.\nEvery raw message contains the following important parts:â€‹\n\n- session alias - unique identifier of business session;\n- direction - <term term=\"direction\">direction</term> of message stream;\n- sequence number - incremental identifier;\n- data - byte representation of a raw message.\n\nSession alias, direction and sequence number are a compound unique identifier of raw messages within th2.\n\n### Message batches\n\n**mstore** consumes `RawMessageBatch` objects. \nEvery batch must be built via the following rules:\n\n- all messages in one batch must have identical `session alias` and `direction`;\n\n- each batch must have messages in ascending order;\n\n- the first message in each batch for session alias + direction pair must have a sequence number that is greater than the last message from the previous batch for the same session alias + direction pair;\n\n- all the parts of one business message must be placed into one th2 batch and also several packages of business messages can be placed into one th2 batch.\n\n<notice note>\n\nSource business message can be split into several pieces when it is transferred via different protocols, for example, FIX message wrapped into HTTP package.\n\n</notice>\n\n<notice note>\n\n**mstore** 4.1+ works with grouped message batches that contains mixed sessions\n\n</notice>\n","fileInfo":{"path":"core/th2-mstore.md"},"headings":[{"anchor":"#th2-mstore","value":"th2-mstore","depth":1},{"anchor":"#overview","value":"Overview","depth":2},{"anchor":"#family","value":"Family","depth":2},{"anchor":"#functionality","value":"Functionality","depth":2},{"anchor":"#configuration","value":"Configuration:","depth":2},{"anchor":"#configuration-parameters","value":"Configuration parameters","depth":3},{"anchor":"#required-pins-and-links","value":"Required pins and links","depth":3},{"anchor":"#configuration-example","value":"Configuration example","depth":3},{"anchor":"#useful-hints","value":"Useful hints","depth":2},{"anchor":"#raw-messages","value":"Raw Messages","depth":3},{"anchor":"#message-batches","value":"Message batches","depth":3}],"read_before":[],"continue_learning":[],"terms":[{"id":"Cradle","title":"Cradle","content":"<p>Cradle is a datalake where th2 stores messages and events.

Message batches from RabbitMQ are placed to this queue and stored to cradle. This queue is configuration limited by batch count and batch sizes at the same time. No new message batch can be added to this queue if queue limits are reached. This prevents mstore from encountering OOM exceptions when many large message batches were stored in parallel, reaching mstore heap limits.\r\n\r\n### Persistence retries\r\n\r\nmstore can be configured to retry message batch persistence in case of failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Message ordering verification improvement\r\n\r\nFor verification purposes when message with new session/direction is handled mstore tries to load its sequence and timestamp from cradle. This is helpful on cold start/restart to verify previous session continuity\r\n\r\n\r\n### Prometheus metrics\r\n\r\nCollecting various performance metrics for exporting to Prometheus.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other\r\n\r\n* Fixed Unicode string serialization / deserialization bug\r\n* Common library has been updated to `3.39.3`\r\n* Cradle library has been updated to `3.1.3`\r\n\r\n","published_at":"2022-09-21T19:28:14Z"},{"id":"59475892","name":"Release 3.6.0","tag_name":"v3.6.0","body":"# What's new in release 3.6.0\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n### Added parameters drain-interval and termination-timeout to custom-settings section\r\n\r\nThe messages rebatching feature provides the ability to collect several small message batches into one according to the actual value of cradle property `cradleMaxMessageBatchSize`, the default value is 1MB.\r\nMstore doesn't split incoming batches into messages and can glue whole batches only. Drain interval - interval in milliseconds to drain all aggregated batches that are not stored yet, the default value is 1000. Termination timeout - timeout in milliseconds to wait for the inner drain scheduler to finish all the tasks, the default value is 5000.\r\n\r\n### Use timeout property from cradle_manager.json\r\n\r\nMstore uses some cradle settings during work. \r\nTimeout defines the maximum limit in milliseconds for inserting new data into the cradle. If set to 0 or omitted, the default value of 5000 is used.\r\nMax message batch size (`cradleMaxMessageBatchSize`) is used by mstore to implement rebatch feature.\r\n\r\n### Check message timestamp growing\r\n\r\nSequence and timestamp of incoming messages should always grow within the session alias and direction. Mstore already checks sequences growing, this version also checks timestamp growing. Mstore rejects the whole batch if the sequence number or timestamp of the first message is less or equal options than the last stored message.\r\n\r\n### [store-common](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-store-common) is not needed anymore\r\n\r\nThere were some common methods for converting and storing.
