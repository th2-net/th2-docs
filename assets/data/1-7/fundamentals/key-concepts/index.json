Each CR is a `yaml` file that describes the state of the box after deployment.\nThe CR contains information such as Docker image and version, resources, pins, etc. \nA set of boxes (in the form of CRs) is provided in infra-schema in a Git repository.\n\n## External Box\n\n_External box_ is an optional feature that allows users to run any th2 box runtime on a local machine like it is already a part of the Kubernetes cluster. \nTo enable this work mode, configure the custom resource to `extended-settings.externalBox.enabled:true` \nThis feature is very useful for temporarily running scripts for specific tasks (including testing activities). \nExternal boxes can also be used to test and debug a new th2 box or run th2 boxes only when required.\n\n\n## Module\nWhile a box is a particular instance in th2 implementation, a *module* is the functional unit within the th2 framework. \nth2 *modules* are responsible for a wide range of functionalities associated with specific software testing actions, such as connecting to external systems, sending and receiving messages, performing rule-based checks.\nOn GitHub, a typical *module* is represented by a family of [th2-net](https://github.com/th2-net) repositories containing source code for a th2 box to be deployed as is, as well as libraries and templates to support creation of custom th2 boxes of a certain functional type.\n\nIn case of customization, a generic Docker image of a specific box is used as a basis for implementing extensions on top of the off-the-shelf functionality of the component (e.g. extensions related to different protocols).\nFor example, the [th2-conn-generic](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-conn-generic) repository contains an implementation of the FIX protocol connectivity extension on top of the basic [th2-conn](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-conn) functionality.\n\nIn th2 implementation, a box functionally representing a *module* is defined through the `Th2Box` kind specified in its Custom Resource, as opposed to the `Th2CoreBox` kind reserved for th2 Core boxes.\n\n\n## Core Box\n_Core boxes_ are th2-boxes that are essential for achieving the business needs of th2.\n Therefore, _core boxes_ are always present in every infra-schema and their custom resources are located in the folder labelled _core_. \n\nAnother way to recognize a _core box_ is by the value of the `kind` field. A custom resource of a _core box_ has the following value: `kind:Th2CoreBox`. This is the norm for all core boxes except for [th2-estore](../../core/th2-estore) and [th2-mstore](../../core/th2-mstore). These two _core boxes_ have their own unique custom resource definition and therefore have unique `kind` values.\n\nUnlike modules, _core boxes_ are not customized and deployed as is.\n\n\n## Message\n\nIn th2, a *Message* is the entity that is used to transfer information to and from a system under test (SUT). \nFor example, if an exchange is being tested, order details are sent to the SUT by a *message*, and the SUT’s execution report is received via a *message*.  \n\nA *message* is an instance of the class `Message`. \nThis class is a data structure that contains attributes such as `parent_event_id`, `messageMetaData`, and `fields`.\n*Messages* are encoded and decoded by the th2 components according to the protocol used and the information in the `messageMetaData` and the `fields` should be set up according to the specification of the protocol.\nThe protocol used is determined by the system that is being tested.\nConsequently, a *message* exists as raw *message* (encoded) of class `RawMessage`, and a parsed *message* (decoded) of class `Message`. \n\nWithin the th2 cluster, *messages* are transferred between the th2 components by the message broker RabbitMQ. \nAll raw *messages* are saved to the th2 data lake using RabbitMQ, the component [th2-message-store](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-mstore), and [Cradle API](https://github.com/th2-net/cradleapi).\nAll *messages* produced are associated with their subsequent test event and can be viewed in the final th2 test report.\n\n## Event\n\n_Event_ in th2 is any noteworthy test action performed by th2 components during a test run.\n\n_Events_ have a hierarchy: an _event_ can relate to another as a parent, or child.\n_Events_ created in different components are not restricted from relating to one another.\nAll _events_ are sent via RabbitMQ to the [th2-event-store](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-estore) component which then saves them in th2’s data lake Cassandra via [Cradle API](https://github.com/th2-net/cradleapi).\n_Events_ are either stored as a single _event_ or as an _event_ batch.\n\nThe saved _events_ are later extracted from the Cassandra and displayed in the th2 test report in a chronologically and hierarchically organized manner.\n\n## Dictionary\nA _dictionary_ is static data/document shared between components.\nIt is present in an infra-schema as a custom resource of kind `Th2Dictionary`.\nWhen an infra-schema is rolled out, the _dictionary_ is converted to a Kubernetes config map (base 64 encoded). \n\nA common use case of a _dictionary_ is defining the protocol specification used by the customer.\nMessages created by the user are cross-referenced against the _dictionary_ to verify that the required information and message structure is present.\nThis ensures that the messages created by th2 are standardized and accepted by the customer’s gateway.\n\n## Pins\nA _pin_ is a point of connection to a box. _Pins_ are required to create channels of communication between boxes. A _pin_ can be used for synchronous and asynchronous messaging depending on its connection type.\n\n_Pins_ required by a module are declared in the module's custom resource by the user. Every declared _pin_ has a `name` and a `connection-type`. \n\n## Links\nA _link_ is a connection between two th2 components.\nIt can describe the directional communication between two pins or the relationship between a box and a dictionary.\n\nA th2 box can be linked to multiple boxes, dictionaries, or a combination of both.\n_Links_ allow th2 users to easily organize the intended relationships within their test environment.\n\nEach individual _link_ is a simple declaration and can be identified by its name.\nAll _links_ are declared in a single custom resource (CR) of kind `Th2Link`.\nThis custom resource is located in its dedicated folder, aptly named links, in the infra-schema.\n\n## Infra Schema\n_Infra-schema_ is an infra component that represents the th2 test environment that will be built, as well as, the design of the test environment infrastructure based on the business requirements.\nAn _infra-schema_ can also be thought of as a set or collection of th2 entities that make up a single test environment. \n\nHowever, each _infra-schema_ is actually a set of declarative manifests called custom resources (CR).\nThe CRs are created for each module, core box, external box, dictionary, declared link, config-file required for the th2 test environment.  \n\nIn a practical sense, the _infra-schema_ enables users to customize test environments by making modifications to CRs.\nThe modifications include editing, adding or deleting the CRs in the _infra-schema_. \nThe user can create multiple _infra-schemas_ based on their needs.\nThe custom _infra-schemas_ are stored as Git repository branches. \n\n\n\n\n\n","fileInfo":{"path":"versions/1-7/fundamentals/key-concepts.md"},"headings":[{"anchor":"#key-concepts","value":"Key concepts","depth":1},{"anchor":"#box","value":"Box","depth":2},{"anchor":"#external-box","value":"External Box","depth":2},{"anchor":"#module","value":"Module","depth":2},{"anchor":"#core-box","value":"Core Box","depth":2},{"anchor":"#message","value":"Message","depth":2},{"anchor":"#event","value":"Event","depth":2},{"anchor":"#dictionary","value":"Dictionary","depth":2},{"anchor":"#pins","value":"Pins","depth":2},{"anchor":"#links","value":"Links","depth":2},{"anchor":"#infra-schema","value":"Infra Schema","depth":2}],"read_before":[],"continue_learning":[],"terms":[],"related":[],"hide_releases":null,"_githubRepository":null}},"context":{}}
