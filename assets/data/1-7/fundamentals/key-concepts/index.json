Each CR is a `yaml` file that describes the state of the box after deployment.\nThe CR contains information such as Docker image and version, resources, pins, etc. \nA set of boxes (in the form of CRs) is provided in infra-schema in a Git repository.\n\n## Module\nWhile a box is a particular instance in th2 implementation, a *module* is the functional unit within the th2 framework. \nth2 *modules* are responsible for a wide range of functionalities associated with specific software testing actions, such as connecting to external systems, sending and receiving messages, performing rule-based checks.\nOn GitHub, a typical *module* is represented by a family of [th2-net](https://github.com/th2-net) repositories containing source code for a th2 box to be deployed as is, as well as libraries and templates to support creation of custom th2 boxes of a certain functional type.\n\nIn case of customization, a generic Docker image of a specific box is used as a basis for implementing extensions on top of the off-the-shelf functionality of the component (e.g. extensions related to different protocols).\nFor example, the [th2-conn-generic](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-conn-generic) repository contains an implementation of the FIX protocol connectivity extension on top of the basic [th2-conn](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-conn) functionality.\n\nIn th2 implementation, a box functionally representing a *module* is defined through the `Th2Box` kind specified in its Custom Resource, as opposed to the `Th2CoreBox` kind reserved for th2 Core boxes.\n\n## Message\n\nIn th2, a *Message* is the entity that is used to transfer information to and from a system under test (SUT). \nFor example, if an exchange is being tested, order details are sent to the SUT by a *message*, and the SUT’s execution report is received via a *message*.  \n\nA *message* is an instance of the class `Message`. \nThis class is a data structure that contains attributes such as `parent_event_id`, `messageMetaData`, and `fields`.\n*Messages* are encoded and decoded by the th2 components according to the protocol used and the information in the `messageMetaData` and the `fields` should be set up according to the specification of the protocol.\nThe protocol used is determined by the system that is being tested.\nConsequently, a *message* exists as raw *message* (encoded) of class `RawMessage`, and a parsed *message* (decoded) of class `Message`. \n\nWithin the th2 cluster, *messages* are transferred between the th2 components by the message broker RabbitMQ. \nAll raw *messages* are saved to the th2 data lake using RabbitMQ, the component [th2-message-store](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-mstore), and [Cradle API](https://github.com/th2-net/cradleapi).\nAll *messages* produced are associated with their subsequent test event and can be viewed in the final th2 test report.\n\n## Event\n\n_Event_ in th2 is any noteworthy test action performed by th2 components during a test run.\n\n_Events_ have a hierarchy: an _event_ can relate to another as a parent, or child.\n_Events_ created in different components are not restricted from relating to one another.\nAll _events_ are sent via RabbitMQ to the [th2-event-store](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-estore) component which then saves them in th2’s data lake Cassandra via [Cradle API](https://github.com/th2-net/cradleapi).\n_Events_ are either stored as a single _event_ or as an _event_ batch.\n\nThe saved _events_ are later extracted from the Cassandra and displayed in the th2 test report in a chronologically and hierarchically organized manner.\n\n","fileInfo":{"path":"versions/1-7/fundamentals/key-concepts.md"},"headings":[{"anchor":"#key-concepts","value":"Key concepts","depth":1},{"anchor":"#box","value":"Box","depth":2},{"anchor":"#module","value":"Module","depth":2},{"anchor":"#message","value":"Message","depth":2},{"anchor":"#event","value":"Event","depth":2}],"read_before":[],"continue_learning":[],"terms":[],"related":[],"hide_releases":null,"_githubRepository":null}},"context":{}}
