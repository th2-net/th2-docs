The repository is common for everyone, but you can fork or clone it if you need to customize values.\n\n[th2-infra-mgr](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-infra-mgr) – a Kubernetes operator responsible for rolling out schemas (**infra-schema** – a test environment configuration based on the [Kubernetes custom resources, or CRs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)) from a Git repository to Kubernetes. It monitors a Git repository and deploys changed components to your [namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/).\n\n[th2-infra-operator](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-infra-operator) – a Java implementation of the Kubernetes [custom resource controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-controllers) for th2 custom components. It monitors custom resources uploaded by **infra-mgr** and uses CRs to configure message/event routing in RabbitMQ or uploads Helm release for further configuration and deployment of th2 boxes.\n\n[th2-infra-schema](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-infra-schema-demo) – a configuration for th2 environment (called `infra-schema`).\n\n[th2-infra-editor](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-infra-editor) –  a GUI for infrastructure management.\n\n## th2 Core \n\n[th2-mstore](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-mstore) – a th2 box that saves raw messages received from an MQ pin into the data lake.\n\n[th2-estore](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-estore) – a th2 box that saves test events from an MQ pin into the data lake.\n\n[th2-rpt-data-provider](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-rpt-data-provider) – a th2 box that interacts with the data lake to retrieve events and messages via user requests.\n\n[th2-rpt-viewer](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-rpt-viewer) – a web-based UI for th2 Reports; displays events and messages provided by the `rpt-data-provider`.\n\n## th2 Modules\n\nAn open set of repositories related to different actions required for testing activities. Examples include but are not limited to:\n- [th2-conn](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-conn)\n- [th2-codec](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-codec-generic)\n- [th2-act-template-j](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-act-template-j)\n- [th2-sim](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-sim)\n- [th2-check2-recon](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-check2-recon-template)\n- [th2-read](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-read-file-common-core)\n- [th2-hand](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-hand)  \n- ...\n\n## th2 Data services\n\n[th2-data-services](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-data-services) – a library for creating `th2-data-services` applications\n\n","fileInfo":{"path":"versions/1-7/fundamentals/architecture.md"},"headings":[{"anchor":"#architecture","value":"Architecture","depth":1},{"anchor":"#th2-infrastructure","value":"th2 Infrastructure","depth":2},{"anchor":"#th2-core","value":"th2 Core","depth":2},{"anchor":"#th2-modules","value":"th2 Modules","depth":2},{"anchor":"#th2-data-services","value":"th2 Data services","depth":2}],"read_before":[],"continue_learning":[],"terms":[],"related":[],"hide_releases":null,"_githubRepository":null}},"context":{}}
