When the message group is full, a new message replaces the oldest one. An appropriate event is sent about this.\n- `rules_package_path` - the path to the rules.\n- `event_batch_max_size` - maximum number of events in one EventBatch.\n- `event_batch_send_interval` - the frequency of sending EventBatch with events.\n- `rules` - list of *rule* configurations.\n\n#### Configuration for each rule in rules list:\n\n- `name` - name of the file with the rule.\n- `enabled` - the flag that toggles the rule usage. Set to `true` to enable.\n- `match_timeout` - time interval between compared messages in seconds. The current time is taken from a new message. For all messages, that arrived earlier than (`actual_time` - `match_timeout`) and did not participate in the checks, the corresponding events will be created.\n- `match_timeout_offset_ns` - the addend for `match_timeout` * 1_000_000_000, if precision to nanoseconds is needed.\n\nExample of the Pod configuration:\n\n```yaml\n##### check2-recon.yaml #####\napiVersion: th2.exactpro.com/v1\nkind: Th2Box\nmetadata:\n  name: recon\nspec:\n  image-name: some_image_name\n  image-version: some_image_version\n  type: th2-check2-recon\n  custom-config:\n    recon_name: Demo_Recon\n    cache_size: 5000\n    event_batch_max_size: 100\n    event_batch_send_interval: 1\n    rules_package_path: rules\n    rules:\n      - name: \"rule_demo_1\"\n        enabled: true\n        match_timeout: 10\n        match_timeout_offset_ns: 0\n        configuration: \"\"\n      - name: \"demo_conn1_vs_demo_conn2\"\n        enabled: true\n        match_timeout: 10\n        match_timeout_offset_ns: 0\n        configuration: \"\"\n      - name: \"demo_conn_vs_demo_dc\"\n        enabled: true\n        match_timeout: 10\n        match_timeout_offset_ns: 0\n        configuration: \"\"\n      - name: \"log_vs_demo_conn\"\n        enabled: true\n        match_timeout: 10\n        match_timeout_offset_ns: 0\n        configuration: \"\"\n      - name: \"refData_vs_demo_conn\"\n        enabled: true\n        match_timeout: 10\n        match_timeout_offset_ns: 0\n        configuration: \"\"\n```\n\n## Rule class\n\nIn files containing the rule class Rule should be defined. Structure of class Rule is as follows.\n\n![Rule class](./rule-class-uml.png)\n\nGetters:\n\n- `get_name()` - name of the rule;\n- `get_description()` - description of the rule;\n- `get_attributes()` - required message stream attributes;\n- `desciption_of_groups()` - dictionary containing names of the groups and its type. \n\nGroup types are available in a **check2-recon** package. At the moment there are 2 group types:\n\n- Type `single` means that all messages in the group have unique hashes (key of the message) - a new message replaces old.\n- Type `multiple` means that several messages with the same hash can be stored in one message group.\n\nExamples of getters:\n\n```python\n##### rule_demo.py #####\ndef get_name(self) -> str:\n       return \"Rule_demo\"\n       \ndef get_description(self) -> str:\n       return \"Rule_demo is used for demo\"\n       \ndef get_attributes(self) -> [list]:\n       return [\n           ['parsed', 'subscribe']\n       ]\n       \n def description_of_groups(self) -> dict:\n       return {'ExecutionReport': MessageGroupType.multi,\n               'NewOrderSingle': MessageGroupType.single}\n```\n\nMethods `group()`, `hash()`, `check()`  in class Rule are responsible for messages processing. \nEvery incoming single message comes to the `group` method, then `hash` method, then `check` method.\n\nThe lifecycle of an incoming message is:\n\n1. Comes in rule from some kind of pin. A record about this is written to log.\n2. The `group(message, attributes)` method is called for this message. It is calculated in which message group the message should be placed.\n3. The hash of the message is calculated using the `hash(message, attributes)`.\n4. Searches for messages with the same hash in other message groups.\n5. If a message with the same hash is found in each group, `check(messages)` is called for all these messages. Depending on the types of message groups and their number, it will be determined which messages to delete and which to keep.\n6. If no similar messages are found, then just add the message to the group.\n\n![Rule flow](./rule-flow-dfd.png)\n\n### group()\n\nMethod `group()` analyses message with an algorithm written by a user and \nsets the message's group id. Further, it will help to reveal the group the \nmessage belongs to. Let us say, it means that we put a message to the group \nwith `group` method.\n\n![Group method](./group-method.png)\n\nImplementation example:\n\n```python\n##### rule_demo.py #####\ndef group(self, message: ReconMessage, attributes: tuple):\n       message_type: str = message.proto_message.metadata.message_type\n       if message_type not in ['ExecutionReport', 'NewOrderSingle']:\n           return\n       message.group_id = message_type\n       message.group_info['message_type'] = message_type\n```\n\n### hash()\n\nMethod `hash()` generates the hash key for the message to join it in the future. \nHash key depends on one or several fields of the message. \nThe fields are defined by a user in `method` implementation. \nIf all these fields are the same in 2 messages, final hash keys also will be equal.\n\n![Hash method](./hash-method.png)\n\nImplementation example:\n\n```python\n##### rule_demo.py #####\ndef hash(self, message: ReconMessage, attributes: tuple):\n       cl_ord_id = message.proto_message.fields['ClOrdID'].simple_value\n       message.hash = hash(message.proto_message.fields['ClOrdID'].simple_value)\n       message.hash_info['ClOrdID'] = cl_ord_id\n```\n\n### check()\n\nMethod `check()` compares the message with all messages from different groups and equal hash key. \nAfter the comparison `check` method generates an event with its result. \nFilling of the final event is defined by the algorithm written by a user. \nAfter that original message is available for comparison with future messages until timeout (message's Time To Live).\n\n![Check method](./check-method.png)\n\nImplementation example:\n\n```python\n##### rule_demo.py #####\ndef check(self, messages: [ReconMessage]) -> Event:\n       settings = ComparisonSettings()\n       compare_result = self.message_comparator.compare(messages[0].proto_message, messages[1].proto_message, settings)\n       verification_component = VerificationComponent(compare_result.comparison_result)\n\n       info_for_name = dict()\n       for message in messages:\n           info_for_name.update(message.hash_info)\n\n       body = EventUtils.create_event_body(verification_component)\n       attach_ids = [msg.proto_message.metadata.id for msg in messages]\n       return EventUtils.create_event(name=f\"Match by '{ReconMessage.get_info(info_for_name)}'\",\n                                      attached_message_ids=attach_ids,\n                                      attached_message_ids=attach_ids,\n                                      body=body)\n```\n\n<!--auto-readme-start-->\n<!--auto-readme-end-->\n","fileInfo":{"path":"versions/1-7/modules/check2-recon/_index.md"},"headings":[{"anchor":"#check2-recon","value":"check2-recon","depth":1},{"anchor":"#overview","value":"Overview","depth":2},{"anchor":"#family","value":"Family","depth":2},{"anchor":"#configuration","value":"Configuration","depth":2},{"anchor":"#custom-resource-configuration","value":"Custom resource configuration","depth":3},{"anchor":"#parameters-defined-for-the-kubernetes-pod-configuration","value":"Parameters defined for the Kubernetes Pod configuration:","depth":4},{"anchor":"#configuration-for-each-rule-in-rules-list","value":"Configuration for each rule in rules list:","depth":4},{"anchor":"#rule-class","value":"Rule class","depth":2},{"anchor":"#group","value":"group()","depth":3},{"anchor":"#hash","value":"hash()","depth":3},{"anchor":"#check","value":"check()","depth":3}],"read_before":[],"continue_learning":[],"terms":[],"related":[{"name":"th2-net/th2-check2-recon","icon":"mdi-github","href":"https://github.com/th2-net/th2-check2-recon"},{"name":"th2-net/th2-grpc-check2-recon","icon":"mdi-github","href":"https://github.com/th2-net/th2-grpc-check2-recon"}],"hide_releases":null,"_githubRepository":{"html_url":"https://github.com/th2-net/th2-check2-recon-template","language":"Python","description":"","updated_at":"2022-03-18T16:44:34Z","owner":{"html_url":"https://github.com/th2-net","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73948563?v=4","login":"th2-net"},"releases":[{"id":"34533731","name":"v2.1.4-beta","tag_name":"v2.1.4-beta","body":"Version for demo-configuration and demo-script.","published_at":"2020-11-28T16:17:19Z"}]}}},"context":{}}
