Class structure of each request.\n</figcaption>\n</center>\n\n\n\n### Parameters in the rule requests\n\nThe following tables provide the list of parameters found in the rule requests.\n\nTable 1. The parameters found in all three rule requests\n\n|Name|Type/Class|Actions Performed / Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|`parent_event_id`|`EventID`|All events generated by the rule will be attached to that parent event.|\n|`connectivity_id`|`ConnectionID`|`session_alias` inside the `connectivity_id` must not be empty.|\n|`direction`|`Direction`|The direction of the messages to be checked by the rule. *Default*: `FIRST`|\n|`chain_id`|`ChainID`|The id used to connect rules together for chain verification. Considers `connectivity_id`.| \n|`description`|`string`|The description that will be added to the root event produced by the rule.|\n|`timeout`|`int64`|The allowed timeout for rule execution (message matching). The allocated time is measured in real time. If not set, the default value from check1 settings will be taken (`rule-execution`-timeout in `Check1.yml`, default: `5000 ms`).|\n|`message_timeout`|`int64`|Defines the allowed timeout for messages matching by the time they were received. Timeout is computed using the message timestamp.|\n|`checkpoint`|`Checkpoint`|Must be set if `message_timeout` is used and no valid `chain_id` is provided.|\n\n\n\n\nTable 2. The parameters unique to `CheckSequenceRuleRequest`\n\n|Name|Type/Class| Actions performed / Description                                                                                    |\n|---|---|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|`root_message_filters`|`RootMessageFilter[]`| An ordered list used to identify messages, to verify `metadata.properties` of the message, and check message order.|\n|`pre_filter`|`PreFilter`| Pre-filtering for the messages that should not be received. Only messages that match the `pre_filter` parameters will be checked by the main filters. |\n|`check_order`|`bool`| If `True`, check1 will validate that messages are received in the defined order.(For example, Execution Report with `OrdStatus`:`Pending` and Execution Report with `OrdStatus`: `New` are received in exactly the same order). |\n|`silence_check`|`google.protobuf.BoolValue`| If `True`, check1 will verify incoming messages, which match the pre-filter, after a CheckSequenceRuleRequest has found all the expected messages. Default: `False`. This feature helps to not miss the bugs, where unexpected messages will be received. |\n\n\n\nTable 3. The parameters unique to `CheckRuleRequest`\n\n|Name|Type/Class|Actions performed / Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|`root_filter`|`RootMessageFilter`|Used to verify `metadata.properties` from the message.|\n\n\nTable 4. The parameters unique to `NoMessageCheckRequest`\n\n|Name|Type/Class| Actions performed / Description                                   |\n|---|---|---|\n|`pre_filter`|`PreFilter`| Pre-filtering for the messages that should not be received. Only messages that match the `pre_filter` parameters will be checked by the main filters.| \n\n","fileInfo":{"path":"versions/1-7/modules/check1/rulerequests.md"},"headings":[{"anchor":"#check1---introduction-to-verification-by-rule-request","value":"check1 - Introduction to verification by rule request","depth":1},{"anchor":"#the-need-for-verification","value":"The need for verification","depth":2},{"anchor":"#the-script","value":"The script","depth":2},{"anchor":"#information-that-is-verified","value":"Information that is verified.","depth":3},{"anchor":"#rules","value":"Rules","depth":2},{"anchor":"#rule-requests","value":"Rule requests","depth":2},{"anchor":"#structure-of-the-three-rule-requests","value":"Structure of the three rule requests","depth":3},{"anchor":"#parameters-in-the-rule-requests","value":"Parameters in the rule requests","depth":3}],"read_before":[],"continue_learning":[],"terms":[],"related":[{"name":"th2-net/th2-check1","icon":"mdi-github","href":"https://github.com/th2-net/th2-check1"}],"hide_releases":null,"_githubRepository":null}},"context":{}}
