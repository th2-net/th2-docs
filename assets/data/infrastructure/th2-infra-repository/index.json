[Helm Operator](https://docs.fluxcd.io/projects/helm-operator/) – a Kubernetes operator allowing one to declaratively manage Helm chart releases. \n2. [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) – one of the most popular open source message brokers used in th2 for managing message flows.\n3. [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html) – a NoSQL distributed database used in the th2 framework to store the history of events and messages.  \n4. [K8s Dashboard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/) – a web-based user interface used to track Kubernetes objects and their hardware usage.\n5. [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/) – flexible dashboard for any data. Here you can track the state of your system and customize views.\n6. [Prometheus](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/getting-started/getting-started-prometheus/) – an open source monitoring system for which Grafana provides out-of-the-box support.\n7. [Grafana Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) – a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system.\n\nAfter any new schema environment is being configured, it automatically connects to RabbitMQ, Cassandra, Dashboard, and Grafana.  \nThe configuration supporting this is stored in the [th2-infra](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-infra) repository.\n\n![](./th2-infra-3.png)\n\n## Interaction with th2\n\nInteraction with th2 can be done via:\n1. K8s Dashboard;\n2. Grafana;\n3. th2 Report GUI for each schema environment; \n4. Infra Editor; \n5. RabbitMQ dashboard.\n\nth2 uses [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) to provide access to corresponding web applications via HTTP.\n\n![](./th2-infra-4.png)\n","fileInfo":{"path":"infrastructure/th2-infra-repository.md"},"headings":[{"anchor":"#th2-infra","value":"th2-infra","depth":1},{"anchor":"#interaction-with-th2","value":"Interaction with th2","depth":2}],"read_before":[],"continue_learning":[],"terms":[],"related":[{"name":"th2-net/th2-infra","icon":"mdi-github","href":"https://github.com/th2-net/th2-infra"}],"hide_releases":null,"_githubRepository":null},"readmeDoc":null},"context":{}}
