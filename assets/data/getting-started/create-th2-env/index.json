For creating a new schema environment just create a new branch with `yaml` files describing it.\n\n<recommendations :items=\"$frontmatter.schema_link\"></recommendations>\n\nNow you can run your test scripts or any software, that simulates activity of real people.\n\n## Persistent Volume for read components\n\nIf you would like to include **read** components into your configuration, you also have to set up a dedicated PersistentVolume for the **read** log directory.\nPersistentVolume mapped to `/opt/components` directory is already created during the installation. Now you need to create a PersistentVolumeClaim. \nPVC example can be found in [`example-values/persistence/`](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-infra/tree/v1.7.3/example-values/persistence).\n\n* create PVC:\n```shell\nkubectl apply -f ./persistence/pvc.yaml\n```\n\nDetails for **read-log ** [README.md](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-read-log#configuration)\n\n## Send requests to environment\n\n<notice info>\n\nSometimes it is [needed](../requirements/software/#tester-box) to install additional software to run external boxes and scripts.\n\n</notice>\n","fileInfo":{"path":"getting-started/create-th2-env.md"},"headings":[{"anchor":"#create-th2-environment","value":"Create th2 environment","depth":1},{"anchor":"#create-environment","value":"Create environment","depth":2},{"anchor":"#persistent-volume-for-read-components","value":"Persistent Volume for read components","depth":2},{"anchor":"#send-requests-to-environment","value":"Send requests to environment","depth":2}],"read_before":[{"title":"Install th2","href":".././install-th2/","icon":"mdi-tune-vertical"}],"continue_learning":[],"terms":[],"related":[],"hide_releases":null,"_githubRepository":null},"readmeDoc":null},"context":{}}
