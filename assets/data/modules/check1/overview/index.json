But the **check1** image is already in the registry for use. This image is pulled to Kubernetes to create a pod.\n- [th2-grpc-check1](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-grpc-check1)\n  - the gRPC check1 library. This library is required for communication by gRPC and includes the `check1.proto` file described below. This library is also used to create and publish the required packages in Python or Java.\n  - [th2-check1.proto](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-grpc-check1/blob/master/src/main/proto/th2_grpc_check1/check1.proto)\n    - The gRPC `check1.proto` file contains the definitions of **check1** service and the data structure of the requests and responses.\n- [th2-grpc-common](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-grpc-common)\n  - This library contains common proto messages that are used in all th2 components. Tool generates code from `.proto` files and uploads built packages (`.proto` files and generated code) to specified repositories.\n  - [th2-grpc-common.proto](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-grpc-common/blob/master/src/main/proto/th2_grpc_common/common.proto)\n    - this gRPC `common.proto` file contains definitions on common classes required by the check1 service.\n\n\nA `.proto` file is the interface definition written using Interface Definition Language (IDL) from Protocol Buffers and defines the interface between a client and server for gRPC. \nThe Protocol Buffers IDL is a custom, platform-neutral language with an open specification.\n\nThe `.proto` file is used to automatically generate language - or platform-specific stubs for clients and servers. \nStubs are needed for parameter conversion so that servers can understand the client requests. \nThe client program imports this interface, while the server program exports this interface.\n\nThe interface allows two components written in two languages to communicate with each other. \nBy sharing `.proto` files, teams can generate code to use each others' services, without needing to take a code dependency.\n\nMore information is available at [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview)\n\n","fileInfo":{"path":"check1/overview.md"},"headings":[{"anchor":"#check1---a-brief-introduction","value":"check1 - a brief introduction","depth":1},{"anchor":"#overview","value":"Overview","depth":2},{"anchor":"#family","value":"Family","depth":2}],"terms":[{"id":"verification","title":"verification","content":"<p>The act of comparing the actual to the expected. </p>\n"}],"meta":{"contentTreeJSON":"[{\"title\":\"check1\",\"path\":\"/modules/check1/\",\"weight\":-100,\"followPath\":\"/modules/check1/overview/\",\"children\":[{\"title\":\"Overview\",\"path\":\"/modules/check1/overview/\",\"weight\":-10,\"followPath\":\"/modules/check1/overview/\",\"children\":[]},{\"title\":\"Rule requests\",\"path\":\"/modules/check1/rulerequests/\",\"weight\":5,\"followPath\":\"/modules/check1/rulerequests/\",\"children\":[]},{\"title\":\"Checkpoints\",\"path\":\"/modules/check1/checkpoints/\",\"weight\":10,\"followPath\":\"/modules/check1/checkpoints/\",\"children\":[]},{\"title\":\"Communication\",\"path\":\"/modules/check1/communication/\",\"weight\":15,\"followPath\":\"/modules/check1/communication/\",\"children\":[]},{\"title\":\"Configuration\",\"path\":\"/modules/check1/configuration/\",\"weight\":20,\"followPath\":\"/modules/check1/configuration/\",\"children\":[]},{\"title\":\"Verification\",\"path\":\"/modules/check1/verification-rulerequests/\",\"weight\":25,\"followPath\":\"/modules/check1/verification-rulerequests/\",\"children\":[]}]}]","module_name":"check1","main_path":"/modules/check1/"}}},"context":{}}
