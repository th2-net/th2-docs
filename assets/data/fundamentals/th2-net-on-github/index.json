They contain libraries and pods source code providing synchronization between th2-infra-schema and th2 environment inside Kubernetes cluster, RabbitMQ server etc.\n- [th2-core](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ath2-core+org%3Ath2-net+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories) repositories contain libraries and boxes providing access to common data storage in th2 environment.\n- [th2-box](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ath2-box+org%3Ath2-net+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories) repositories contain source code for some logical module of th2.\n\n## Technology support topics\n\nAlso, th2 modules can support different technologies. It can be reflected in topics as well:\n- [grpc](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Agrpc+org%3Ath2-net+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories)\n- [fix](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Afix+org%3Ath2-net+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories)\n- [native](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Anative+org%3Ath2-net+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories)\n- [soup](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Asoup+org%3Ath2-net+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories)\n- [rest-api](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Arest-api+org%3Ath2-net+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories)\n- [otherprotocols](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aotherprotocols+org%3Ath2-net+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories)\n- [webui](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Awebui+org%3Ath2-net+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories)\n\n## th2-net map\n\nYou also can track dependencies on this auto-generated graph.\n\n[![th2 dependencies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d0rich/th2-dependencies/master/output/schema.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d0rich/th2-dependencies/master/output/schema.svg)\n","fileInfo":{"path":"fundamentals/th2-net-on-github.md"},"headings":[{"anchor":"#th2-net-on-github","value":"th2-net on GitHub","depth":1},{"anchor":"#usage-topics","value":"Usage topics","depth":2},{"anchor":"#functionality-topics","value":"Functionality topics","depth":2},{"anchor":"#box-groups-topics","value":"Box groups topics","depth":2},{"anchor":"#technology-support-topics","value":"Technology support topics","depth":2},{"anchor":"#th2-net-map","value":"th2-net map","depth":2}],"read_before":[],"continue_learning":[],"terms":[],"related":[],"hide_releases":null,"_githubRepository":null},"readmeDoc":null},"context":{}}
