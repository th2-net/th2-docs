The infrastructure of th2 consists of elements collectively referred to as Infra-Components. 
One of the components is the infra-schema, which is a test environment designed using th2 boxes of type <term term='core'>Core</term> and <term term='module'>Module</term>. 
The rest of the infra components work together to monitor and maintain this test environment in a state desired by the user.
Finally, users can change or update a deployed test environment using these infra-components.

In addition to information about the infra components this section will also cover the “Theory of Pins and Links”.
Pins and Links are th2’s unique solution to setting up communication between the various th2 boxes found in the infra-schema.
