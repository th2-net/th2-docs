## Overview
**check1** is a component of th2 that performs message <term term='verification'>verification</term> at the userâ€™s request. 
The user can request verification by submitting a <term term='rule request'>rule request</term> which invokes a <term term='rule (check1)'>rule</term> found in **check1**.

<notice info>
<!-- TODO: add these as hover over terms -->

A **rule** is logic used for verifying system messages.

A **rule request** contains information required for verification and calls the respective **rule** for execution.

</notice>

During verification **check1** checks if the system's message is accurate.

A system message is also called an execution report and contains details about the trade (order execution).

The system can return more than one message in response to an order.

<!-- TODO: change this sentence to better reflect the articles idea -->
This section explains how **check1** identifies system messages using chain verification with `chain_id`.

## Examples and scenario
Imagine a scenario where the user submits two consecutive trade orders (messages) to the system.

The user will expect 2 messages from the system in response to each order message sent to the system.

### Example 1: Using two separate `CheckSequenceRuleRequests` with checkpoints

Figure 1. A chain of system messages (responses) from the same `session alias` in the same `direction`.

</figcaption>
</center>

Figure 1 shows a message queue with the messages from the same `session alias` and `direction = FIRST` (from the system). 
Upon successful submission of each of the orders, two <term term='checkpoint'>checkpoints</term> are created.

After receiving the first `CheckSequenceRuleRequest`, **check1** begins verification at `checkpoint1`. 
The user is expecting Message 4 and Message 5 as responses to the order Message 1, and **check1** identifies these messages using the `key_fields_list` provided in the first `CheckSequenceRuleRequest`.

Similarly, **check1** begins verification at `checkpoint2` and identifies Message 7 and Message 8. 
In each case of successful order message verification, the user is notified accordingly.

In our example, however, Message 6 is not identified. 
Message 6 is a response from the system that was not expected by the user and therefore was not identified by the first `CheckSequenceRuleRequest`. 
Moreover, as **check1** identifies Message 6 as `checkpoint2`, it was not checked by the second `CheckSequenceRuleRequest`. 

Message 6 is an extra message. 
Identification of extra/redundant messages is important as their presence can indicate a  potential defect in the system under test.

<notice info>
<!-- TODO : make into hover over terms -->

Any message that passes `PreFilter` but is not identified by the main filter is considered as an extra message. 

</notice>


### Example2: Using two linked CheckSequenceRuleRequests

After the first `CheckSequenceRuleRequest` is sent to **check1**, it will start verification from `checkpoint1`, but the user now requests a <term term='chain id'>`chain_id`</term> from the first `CheckSequenceRuleRequest`.

**check1** creates the `chain_id` caret which acts as a pointer to the verified message. 
This caret stops at the last verified message. 
The `chain_id` of Message 5 is returned as the last verified message with the `CheckSequenceResponse`.

<figcaption>

Figure 2. `chain_id` caret marks the last verified message, which is used as the starting point for the next `CheckSequenceRuleRequest`.

</figcaption>
</center>

The user can now request this `chain_id` in their second `CheckSequenceRuleRequest`, and **check1** will start verification from Message 6. 
**check1** will identify Message 6 as an extra system response and inform the user that there is a redundant message.

<center>
<figcaption>

Figure 3. After the second `CheckSequenceRuleRequest`

</figcaption>
</center>

**check1** temporarily stores the `chain_id`. 
The storage time is determined by the **check1** custom configuration `cleanup-older-than` with `cleanup-time-unit`. 
Therefore, `chain_id` is removed once the verified message chain is removed. 

Using this stored `chain_id` we can link as many `CheckSequenceRuleRequests` as required to conduct a complete check of the whole message chain. 
This act of "chaining" rule requests together is called chain verification. 

### Example 4 : Messages from different instruments

![](/img/cookbook/chain-verification/two_instruments2.png "Figure4.two_instruments2")

</figcaption>
</center>

We can request two `CheckSequenceRuleRequests` from the checkpoint - the first for verification of two messages on `Instrument1` and the second for verification of two messages on `Instrument2`. 
Then the two `chain_id` carets will be created, with each of them stopping when the desired messages are found. 
Each desired message is searched based on the key fields of each individual filter in `CheckSequenceRuleRequest`.


### Usage Example for chain_id

```python
#...
check_connection = grpc.insecure_channel(check1_addr)
check = verifier_pb2_grpc.VerifierStub(check_connection)

# We can create chain_id for the first request, or leave it blank and use it from checkpoint.
chain_id = verifier_pb2.ChainID(id=str(uuid.uuid1()))

# First request starts from the checkpoint and initiates a chain.       
ver1_chain = check.submitCheckSequenceRule(CheckSequenceRuleRequest(
            description=f'Trader "{input_parameters["trader1"]}" receives Execution Report. '
            f'The order stands on book in status NEW',
            chain_id=chain_id,
            connectivity_id=ConnectionID(session_alias=input_parameters['trader1_fix']),
            checkpoint=order1_response.checkpoint_id,
            timeout=3000,
            parent_event_id=input_parameters['case_id'],
            pre_filter=PreFilter(fields={'SecurityID': ValueFilter(simple_filter=Instrument)}),
            message_filters = [filter_object]
        ))
        
# For the second request we can use chain_id from the response, or from the script if we fill it in the first request.
check.submitCheckSequenceRule(CheckSequenceRuleRequest(
            description=f'Trader "{input_parameters["trader1"]}" receives Execution Reports: '
            f'first at Order2 and second on Order1 .',
            connectivity_id=ConnectionID(session_alias=input_parameters['trader1_fix']),
            chain_id=ver1_chain.chain_id,
            timeout=3000,
            parent_event_id=input_parameters['case_id'],
            pre_filter=PreFilter(fields={'SecurityID': ValueFilter(simple_filter=Instrument)}),
            message_filters=[er_2vs3_filter, er_1vs3_filter],
            check_order=True))
            
# For future requests we can use stored chain_id.
#...
```
