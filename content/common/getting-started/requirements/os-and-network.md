<!-- ## Kubernetes minimum requirements
Machines that meet Kubernetes minimum requirements for the workers
https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/#before-you-begin -->

## Operational system

|OS|Version|
|---|---|
|Ubuntu|16.04+|
|Debian|9+|
|CentOS|7|
|Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)|7|
|Fedora|25+|

## Network

1. Unique hostname, MAC address, and product_uuid for every node.
2. `swap` disabled. You **MUST** disable `swap` in order for the kubelet to work properly.
3. Full network connectivity between all machines in the cluster (public or private network).
4. `sudo` privileges on all machines.
5. SSH access from one device to all nodes in the system.

## Kubernetes ports

Certain ports are open on your machines.
https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/#check-required-ports

## Cassandra ports

|Port|Type|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|7000|TCP|cluster communication|
|7001|TCP|cluster communication (SSL enabled)|
|9042|TCP|native protocol clients|
|7199|TCP|JMX|

### Customization

The internode communication and native protocol
ports are configurable in the Cassandra Configuration File.

The JMX
port is configurable in cassandra-env.sh (through JVM options).


## Connectivity to repositories and registries

Check if your machine has access to the following endpoints.

Repositories:

- kubernetes-dashboard: https://kubernetes.github.io/dashboard/
- flux: https://charts.fluxcd.io
- ingress-nginx: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
- loki: https://grafana.github.io/loki/charts
- th2: https://th2-net.github.io

<notice note>

If you have an `error 404` message, it is OK. However, if your connection
to a resource is broken, you'll see a `this site canâ€™t be reached` error.

</notice>

Container registries:
- ghcr.io
- quay.io
- docker.io
- k8s.gcr.io

<notice note>

Accessibility of container registries should be tested using Docker.
