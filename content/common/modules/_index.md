This section provides descriptions of modules which are a part of th2 microservices architecture. 

A **module** in th2 ecosystem is understood as a family of repositories aimed at creation of a th2 box of a particular functional type, i.e. a box performing a particular action relevant for the testing process (for example, sending or receiving a message, encoding/decoding, performing rule-based checks). 

In the broader th2 ecosystem, modules can be open-source or proprietary. This th2 documentation portal covers open-source modules exclusively. However, most of open-source modules in [th2-net](https://github.com/th2-net) contain repositories that can be used as templates to create one's own component with the same function.

The subsections below describe some of the modules contributed by Exactpro. The list is open to changes and updates.
