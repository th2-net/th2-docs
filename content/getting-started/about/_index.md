## What is th2?

[th2](https://github.com/th2-net) is an open-source toolkit providing end-to-end functional and non-functional test automation for complex distributed transaction processing systems such as securities trading systems and exchanges, banking, brokerage, post-trade (e.g. clearing, settlement, custody), and payments platforms. Built as a cloud native Kubernetes-driven microservices solution, it aims to help regulated entities stay compliant and resilient to disruption, while focusing on innovation and having the freedom to embrace emerging technologies.

## th2 benefits

- **open interface**: a multi-platform framework with a powerful API, enabling intelligent interaction with many widely adopted network protocols as well as API, UI, DLT and cloud endpoints
- **technology stack diversity**: th2 can perform tests written in different programming languages (Python, Java, C++, Kotlin, etc.)
- **microservices architecture**: provides configuration agility for building complex test instruments and execute sophisticated test algorithms, including model-based testing approaches
- **DevOps/GitOps paradigm**: enables CI/CD pipeline integration
- **high-volume automated testing**: designed to perform autonomous test execution of more functional tests under load to improve test coverage, system quality and resilience
- **data-driven approach**: ready for implementation of AI-driven test libraries for machine learning and advanced data analytics, enhanced data capabilities including faster data processing and unified storage of test results
- **data governance**: unified storage of distributed test data and results in the Cassandra database to enable better access to test evidence and smart analytics for governance and regulatory compliance
- **performance**: processes multiple data streams in parallel
- **scalability**: can be distributed between several hardware, additional computing power can be quickly involved in testing process allowing testing close to thresholds and exceeding them
