# System requirements

When allocating resources for your th2 solution, follow the guidelines below:
- The right balance of CPUs, memory, disks, number of nodes depends on your particular use case, the number of services you are planning to deploy, and expected data load.
- General recommendations for [Hardware](hardware), [OS and network](os-and-network), and [Software](software) are available in the corresponding sections.
- Approximate configuration options for a few use cases are available in the [Sample hardware configurations](hardware/#sample-hardware-configurations) section.
  The suggested hardware is the required minimum. You may need to increase CPU capacity, memory,
  and disk space beyond the recommended minimums.
- The minimal working disk capacity, CPU and memory required for the th2 installation can be calculated via the [Hardware Calculator](hardware/#minimal-hardware-requirements-calculator).
