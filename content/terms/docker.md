*Docker* (specifically, *Docker Engine*) is a software technology providing operating-system-level virtualization also known as containers. It uses the resource isolation features and a union-capable file system to allow independent containers to run within a single instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines.

You can find more information about *Docker* [here](https://docs.docker.com/).
