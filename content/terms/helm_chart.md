title: Helm Chart
---

*Helm Chart* is a package of pre-configured Kubernetes resources that can be managed with the Helm tool. *Helm Charts* provide a reproducible way of creating and sharing Kubernetes applications. A single *Helm Chart* can be used to deploy something simple, like a memcached Pod, or something complex, like a full web app stack with HTTP servers, databases, caches, and so on.
