title: Kubernetes Cluster
---

*Kubernetes Cluster* is a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every *Kubernetes Cluster* has at least one worker node. The worker node(s) host the Pods that are the components of the application workload. The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the *Kubernetes Cluster*. In production environments, the control plane usually runs across multiple computers and a *Kubernetes Cluster* usually runs multiple nodes, providing fault-tolerance and high availability.
