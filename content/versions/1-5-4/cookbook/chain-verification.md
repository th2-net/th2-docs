## Overview
**check1** is a component of th2 that performs message verification at the userâ€™s request. Users can request verification by submitting a **rule request** which invokes a **rule** found in **check1**.

<notice info>
<!-- TODO: add these as hover over terms -->

A **rule** is some logic used for verifying system messages.

A **rule request** contains information required for verification and calls the respective rule for execution.

</notice>

Message verification checks if a system's message is accurate.

A system message is also called an execution report and contains details about the order or the trade.

The system can return more than one message in response to an order.

In this article we will look at how **check1** identifies system messages using **chain verification** with `chain_id`.

## Examples and scenario
Imagine a scenario where a user submits two consecutive trade orders (messages) to the system.

The user expects 2 messages from the system for each message sent to the system.

### Example 1: Using two separate CheckSequenceRuleRequests with checkpoints

Figure 1. A chain of system messages (responses) from the same session alias in the same direction.

</center>

Figure 1 shows a message queue with the messages from the same **session alias** and `direction = FIRST` (from the system). Two checkpoints have been created after the successful submission of each order.

**Check1** creates checkpoint1 and begins verification at checkpoint1 after receiving the first `CheckSequenceRuleRequest`. The user is expecting message 4 and message 5 as responses to order message 1, and **check1** identifies these messages using the `key_fields_list` provided in the first `CheckSequenceRuleRequest`.

Similarly, **check1** begins verification at checkpoint2 and verifies the expected message 7 and message 8. The user is informed about the successful verification for each order.

However, message 6 was not identified. Message 6 is a response from the system that was not expected by the user and therefore was not identified by the first `CheckSequenceRuleRequest` . Moreover, because **check1 ** identifies message 6 as checkpoint2 it was not checked by the second `CheckSequenceRuleRequest`. 

Therefore, message 6 is what is known as an **extra message**. Identification of extra messages is important as their prescence can indicate a prevailing issue in the system under test.

<notice info>
<!-- TODO : make into hover over terms -->

Any message that passes `PreFilter` but are not identified by the main filter is considered an extra message. 

</notice>


### Example2 : Using two linked CheckSequenceRuleRequests

After the first `CheckSequenceRuleRequest` is sent to **check1**, it will start verification from the checkpoint1, but the user now requests a `chain_id` from the first `CheckSequenceRuleRequest`.

**check1** creates the chain_id caret which acts as a pointer to the verified message. This caret stops at the last verified message. The `chain_id` of message 5 is returned as the last verified message with the `CheckSequenceResponse`.

Figure 2. Chain_id caret marks the last verified message, which is used as the starting point for the next CheckSequenceRuleRequest.

</figcaption>
</center>

The user can now request this `chain_id` in their second `CheckSequenceRuleRequest` and **check1** will start verifying from message 6. **check1** will identify message 6 as an extra system response and informs the user that there is an extra message.

Figure 3. After the second `CheckSequenceRuleRequest`

</figcaption>
</center>

**check1** temporarily stores the `chain_id` . The storage time is determined by the **check1** custom configuration `cleanup-older-than` with `cleanup-time-unit`. Therefore `chain_id` is removed once the verified message chain is removed. 

Using this stored `chain_id` we can link as many `CheckSequenceRuleRequests` as required to conduct a complete check of the whole message chain. This act of **"chaining"** rule requests together is called chain verification. 

### Example 4 : Messages from different instruments

![](/img/cookbook/chain-verification/two_instruments2.png "Figure4.two_instruments2")

<center>
<figcaption>

Figure 4. Checking messages from different instruments

</figcaption>
</center>

We can request two `CheckSequenceRuleRequest`s from checkpoint - the first for verification of two messages on `Instrument1` and the second for verification of two messages on `Instrument2`; then two chain_id carets will be created, with each of them stopping when desired messages are found. The desired message is searched based on the key fields of each individual filter in `CheckSequenceRuleRequest`.


### Usage Example for chain_id

```python
#...
check_connection = grpc.insecure_channel(check1_addr)
check = verifier_pb2_grpc.VerifierStub(check_connection)

# We can create chain_id for first request, or leave it blank and use it from checkpoint.
chain_id = verifier_pb2.ChainID(id=str(uuid.uuid1()))

# First request starts from checkpoint and initiates a chain.       
ver1_chain = check.submitCheckSequenceRule(CheckSequenceRuleRequest(
            description=f'Trader "{input_parameters["trader1"]}" receives Execution Report. '
            f'The order stands on book in status NEW',
            chain_id=chain_id,
            connectivity_id=ConnectionID(session_alias=input_parameters['trader1_fix']),
            checkpoint=order1_response.checkpoint_id,
            timeout=3000,
            parent_event_id=input_parameters['case_id'],
            pre_filter=PreFilter(fields={'SecurityID': ValueFilter(simple_filter=Instrument)}),
            message_filters = [filter_object]
        ))
        
# For second request we can use chain_id from response, or from script if we fill it in first request.
check.submitCheckSequenceRule(CheckSequenceRuleRequest(
            description=f'Trader "{input_parameters["trader1"]}" receives Execution Reports: '
            f'first at Order2 and second on Order1 .',
            connectivity_id=ConnectionID(session_alias=input_parameters['trader1_fix']),
            chain_id=ver1_chain.chain_id,
            timeout=3000,
            parent_event_id=input_parameters['case_id'],
            pre_filter=PreFilter(fields={'SecurityID': ValueFilter(simple_filter=Instrument)}),
            message_filters=[er_2vs3_filter, er_1vs3_filter],
            check_order=True))
            
# For future requests we can use stored chain_id.
...
