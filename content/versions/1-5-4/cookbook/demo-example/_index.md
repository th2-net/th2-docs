Demo example contains script examples that demonstrates how th2 works. 

To run the demo script you will need Kubernetes cluster with th2 setup. 

"Quick demo setup" is an optional step. It doesnâ€™t require having Kubernetes with th2 setup, so you can refer to this section when you want to try out th2 without going deep into details of installation process.

Keep in mind that it is not recommended use demo example for production purposes. If you want to try out th2 at its full capacity, refer to the instructions from [Getting started](../getting-started) -> [Install th2](../getting-started/install-th2).
