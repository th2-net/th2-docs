# System requirements
When choosing hardware for your th2 solution, follow the guidelines below:
- The right balance of CPUs, memory, disks, number of nodes depends on your particular use case, the number of services you are planning to deploy, and expected data load.
- General recommendations for [Hardware](./requirements/hardware), [OS and network](./requirements/os-and-network), and [Software](./requirements/software) are available in the corresponding sections.
- Approximate configuration options for a few use cases are available in the [Sample hardware configurations](./requirements/hardware#sample-hardware-configurations) section.
  The suggested hardware is the required minimum. You may need to increase CPU capacity, memory,
  and disk space beyond the recommended minimums.
- The minimal working disk capacity, CPU and memory required for the th2 installation can be calculated via the [Hardware Calculator](./requirements/hardware#minimal-hardware-requirements-calculator).
