# Create testing environment

You can create modules for your custom test logic and architect any system from them. 

All you need is to create Docker images of your module and describe it in the `th2-infra-schema` repository. Every branch in this repository is a custom configuration for the th2 environment. 

We have prepared demonstration environment for you. All the modules are already in the container registry. To try it, you just need to create a branch in the `th2-infra-schema` with the content from our branch for th2 1.5.4 test configuration.

<recommendations :items="test_config"></recommendations>

As we have already created our `th2-infra-schema` from this template, we will just create a new branch from this one.

We have created a new branch from the `ver-1.5.4-main_scenario` to not commit changes in
the base configuration.

In the new branch you need to edit `infra-mgr-config.yml`: in order to automatically apply all dependencies from the _ `th2-infra-schema`_ 
variable `spec.k8s-propagation` should be configured as `rule` instead of `off`. Let's commit changes.

```yml[infra-mgr-config.yml]
kind: SettingsFile
metadata:
  name: infra-mgr-config
spec:
  k8s-propagation: rule
```


The `th2-infra-mgr` is monitoring your infra schema repository.
After described actions are complete, it will create `th2-<new_branch_name>` namespace and deploy all needed components.

A new schema is available in the infra editor.

Infra Editor will create a new namespace `th2-<new_schema_name>` in Kubernetes cluster for the new schema.
It can require some time. There will be pods for this environment in Kubernetes cluster. You can go to the Kubernetes dashboard and see it.

## Prepare environment

In our environment `ver-1.5.4-main_scenario` there are some external boxes. Boxes of this type should be run on your machine from outside the cluster. 

<notice note>

You will need configured  `kubectl` to work with your cluster.

### Clone simulator boxes

Clone [Simulator](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-sim-template) branch for the demo script:

```shell
git clone -b demo-ver-1.5.4-local --single-branch https://github.com/th2-net/th2-sim-template.git
```

Clone [Log reader](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-read-log) branch for the demo script:

```shell
git clone -b demo-ver-1.5.4-local --single-branch https://github.com/th2-net/th2-read-log.git
```

Clone [CSV reader](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-read-log) branch for the demo script:

```shell
git clone -b demo-ver-1.5.4-local --single-branch https://github.com/th2-net/th2-read-csv.git
```

### Run simulator boxes

Run CSV reader:

```shell
gradle run --args='--namespace <schema-namespace> --boxName read-csv --contextName $(kubectl config current-context)'
```

Run Log reader:

```shell
gradle run --args='--namespace <schema-namespace> --boxName read-log --contextName $(kubectl config current-context)'
```

Run simulator:

```shell
gradle run --args='--namespace <schema-namespace> --boxName sim-demo --contextName $(kubectl config current-context)'
```
