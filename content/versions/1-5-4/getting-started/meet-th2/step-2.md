**th2-infra-schema** is probably the most important component in your testing process. 
Technically, it is just a repository in the Git system. th2 synchronizes with this repository
and changes your system, if the changes are made in the schema. 

With this instruction you will copy demonstration schema to your GitHub. No worries, all the components are already prepared and accessible for free use.

As a result of this and the previous steps, you should have the following part of the th2
framework ready:

## th2-infra-schema

**th2-infra-schema** is an abstract representation of interdependencies between the th2 components.
The actual schemas in the form of repositories are created in line with the purpose of the testing system that you are building.

Some configuration examples of the **th2-infra-schema** repository are available in different branches of the
[`th2-infra-schema-demo`](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-infra-schema-demo/tree/master) repository.

See the [Theory of pins and links](../../fundamentals/pins-and-links) section for more information.

You can publish the th2-infra-schema in two possible ways:
1. [Default](#default-publish-th2-infra-schema-to-create-a-th2-environment-by-editing-repository) - GitHub-based. You will edit schemas by editing the repository.
2. [Alternative](#alternative-publish-th2-infra-schema-to-create-a-th2-environment-via-a-th2-gui) - GUI-based. You will edit schemas via the th2-infra-editor GUI.

## Publish the th2-infra-schema

[`th2-infra-schema-demo`](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-infra-schema-demo/tree/master)
is the template repository with predefined schemas, which you can use.

Fork the [`th2-infra-schema-demo`](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-infra-schema-demo/tree/master)
repository or use it as a template. It can be either **public** or **private**.

<notice info >

th2 will synchronize with the published **th2-infra-schema** using `ssh` or `https` depending on the system where your th2-infra-schema is published (GitLab or GitHub accordingly). th2 configuration file should contain a correct link to the **th2-infra-schema** repository.

</notice >

## Provide access to the _th2-infra-schema_ Git repository for _th2-infra-mgr_

The `th2-infra-mgr` component monitors the `th2-infra-schema` repository and updates it
according to the user's actions in the `th2-infra-editor` GUI. The `th2-infra-mgr` component needs access with write permissions.

GitHub repositories can be accessed via personal access tokens. In case you cannot use a token, update your th2 version to use ssh connection. 

<recommendations :items="tokens_link" ></recommendations>

It is required to grant permissions from `repo` scope. Other permissions are not needed.

![Token permissions](/img/getting-started/install-th2/gh-token-permissions.png)

You will need generated token in the next step.

Create `infra-mgr` secret required by `th2-infra-mgr`.

```shell
kubectl -n service create secret generic infra-mgr --from-literal=infra-mgr=infra-mgr
```
